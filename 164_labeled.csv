He apologized 10 days later in a statement following outrage from the local community.WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HEREMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List, told Fox News that she was disappointed by the vote.""They can’t even muster up the courage to have a discussion about whether he should be removed or not,"" she said. ""A group that doesn’t have the moral fortitude to take him out ought to also be unelected.""A flier for the protest planned in Framingham, Massachusetts, in response to Michael Hugo s comments about abortion that left parents irate. (Facebook)She added that this ""point of pivotal moral outrage"" should concern all communities, not just Framingham.""Anyone who sets out to target the vulnerable in the community for extinction should not be in any position of leadership anywhere,"" she said, again calling for his resignation.""Usually these attitudes are tapped down and are not allowed to get the megaphone that we’ve just heard. But it’s in the imprint in who the modern abortion movement is, which is the deep roots of eugenics,"" Dannenfelser said.SBA List issued a statement following Fox News’ coverage on Hugo calling for his resignation.MA REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR CHARLES BAKER SIGNS BILL PROTECTING ABORTION RIGHTS""The abortion lobby is wildly out of step with the American people in treating children with a disability as a commodity and a tax burden – the opposite of their families’ experience,"" Dannenfelser said in the press release, citing statistics about parents being pressured to abort when their children are diagnosed with Down syndrome despite a claim that 99% of people with the syndrome live happy lives.""Hugo’s comments reflect the formal position of leading Democrats who refuse to name a single limit on abortion they support,"" the statement adds. ""They are radically out of touch with public consensus, medical and civil rights progress, and basic humanity. All decent Americans, including Democrats brave enough to reject the party line, should speak out against pro-abortion extremism.""Dannenfelser, who has a child with an intellectual disability, told Fox News that she believes special needs children and adults sometimes have more ""obvious purpose"" in the world than those without disabilities.Dannenfelser believes that because Roe v. Wade was overturned that Democrats have an ability to clarify what they believe. (iStock)""They’re just natural teachers to everyone around them about what love and humility is and what purity of heart and soul is at a time when there is so much polarization and callousness,"" she said. ""Everyone knows someone with special needs, and who looks at them and says, ‘We’d be better off without them?’ which is exactly what we just heard.""Dannenfelser believes that because Roe v. Wade was overturned that Democrats have an ability to clarify what they believe.MASSACHUSETTS DEMOCRAT TOLD TO STEP DOWN AFTER ABORTION COMMENTS LEAVE PARENTS IRATE""They’re already saying things like, ‘I’m pro-choice, but I’m not for that,’"" she said. ""That is the beginning of the unwinding of the whole pro-abortion movement narrative is moments like this that show the ugly underbelly of what the abortion movement is, which is a eugenics movement.""At the Framingham Democratic Committee, members voted unanimously to accept the committee’s statement denouncing Hugo’s remarks that claimed his comments did not reflect the full committee.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTo learn more about the backlash to Hugo, click here.Kassy Dillon is a reporter for Digital Originals.

8,Supreme Court to hear arguments on constitutionality of ‘Elizabeth Warren’s baby’ – the CFPB,"   Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren got into a back-and-forth with FTX paid spokesman Kevin O Leary over whether cryptocurrency facilitates money laundering.The Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments in the case against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFBP) that could knock the legs out from under the agency that has been a thorn in the side of Republicans since Elizabeth Warren helped create it after the 2008 market crash.The issue before the court is how the CFPB is funded – the financial watchdog agency bypasses typical congressional appropriations and simply requires the CFPB director to make requests of the Treasury Department for funds as needed. The banking industry parties challenging the CFPB say that is unconstitutional, citing the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution.Last October, a lower court in the Fifth Circuit ruled that the mechanism was ""double-insulated"" from congressional oversight and therefore unconstitutional.The Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court to hear its arguments to undo that decision, which the Court announced on Monday it would do, but not on the expedited timeline for which the administration asked. Oral arguments will likely be this fall, meaning a decision in the case would not come until mid-2024.SUPREME COURT TO HEAR GOP STATE CHALLENGE TO PANDEMIC-RELATED BIDEN STUDENT LOAN DEBT RELIEF PLANThe Supreme Court will hear arguments later this year on the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)FIVE BIG CASES THE SUPREME COURT WILL HEAR OVER THE NEXT FOUR WEEKSThe Obama-era CFPB was formed in the aftermath of the 2008 market crash in an effort to protect consumers from financial schemes, with authority to regulate banking and lending agencies via federal rules. Warren, now a Democrat senator from Massachusetts, is credited for creating the agency, although she never led it.Warren s 2020 presidential campaign website says she ""camewith the idea for the CFPB before the crisis even began and then fought successfully to turn her idea into a reality.""""This agency was Elizabeth’s idea, and through sheer force of will, intelligence, and a bottomless well of energy, she has made, and will continue to make, a profound and positive difference for our country,"" President Obama said in July 2011.Trump s former acting CFPB Director Mick Mulvaney even called the agency ""Elizabeth Warren’s baby.""Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., speaks during a protest outside the U.S. Supreme Court Tuesday, May 3, 2022. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)On Monday, Warren rejected the push to find it unconstitutional.""Despite years of desperate attacks from Republicans and corporate lobbyists, the constitutionality of the CFPB and its funding structure have been upheld time and time again,"" she said.""If the Supreme Court follows more than a century of law and historical precedent, it will strike down the Fifth Circuit’s decision before it throws our financial markets and economy into chaos.""TWITTER ARGUES BEFORE SUPREME COURT THAT LETTING ISIS USE PLATFORM NOT THE SAME AS AIDING AND ABETTING TERRORThe CPFB has already sustained a blow to its autonomy from the Supreme Court in 2020 through a Trump administration challenge, in which the nine justices ruled that a president could fire an CPFB director at will. Prior to that decision, a CFPB director, after appointment by the Senate, would serve five years and could only be fired for malfeasance, inefficiency or neglect of duty.The nine Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. (Collection of the Supreme Court of the United States via Getty Images)Republicans have long criticized the agency for what they say is lack of transparency and oversight. Rep.

FIRST ON FOX: Republican leaders on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee are investigating the Biden administration s billion-dollar environmental justice grant program over concerns of potential waste, fraud and abuse.Oversight Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., and Rep. Pat Fallon, R-Texas, the chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy and Regulatory Affairs, informed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael Regan in a letter Monday that they had initiated oversight into the program. The two GOP leaders requested documents, information and a staff-level briefing on the matter.""The Oversight Committee is putting the American people first by bringing transparency to how billions of taxpayer dollars allocated to the EPA under the Democrats’ so-called Inflation Reduction Act are being spent,"" Comer said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital.""While doing nothing to reduce inflation, the IRA allocated billions of dollars to environmental grant programs that can’t even prove they deliver results for the environment,"" he added. ""The American people deserve to know that their tax dollars are being spent on programs that work, and we will hold them accountable.""JOHN KERRY S SECRET CCP NEGOTIATIONS PROBED BY GOP OVERSIGHT CHAIRMANHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., speaks during a news conference on Nov. 17, 2022. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the $739 billion climate and tax bill President Biden signed in August, earmarked tens of billions of dollars for so-called environmental justice spending. The legislation included $3 billion for two EPA programs the agency said ""will aggressively advance environmental justice and support projects like community-led air pollution monitoring, prevention and remediation.""In January, the EPA announced it had made $100 million available for environmental groups under the IRA programs. The agency made another $550 million available late last week.NEARLY 200 GOP LAWMAKERS BLAST BIDEN S EPA FOR TARGETING FARMERS, RANCHERS:  EGREGIOUS FEDERAL OVERREACH ""I couldn’t be prouder to now be announcing an unprecedented level of funding thanks to President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act for community-based solutions that support underserved and overburdened communities,"" Regan said on Jan. 10.The two programs — the Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving Program (EJCPS) Cooperative Agreement Program and Environmental Justice Government-to-Government (EJG2G) Program — particularly focus on climate change mitigation, projects benefiting rural communities and projects that conduct health impact assessments.Comer and Fallon cited a 2021 EPA report that found rampant abuse in past environmental justice programs. The report found that many organizations receiving federal funding had defined environmental issues they planned to address too broadly.EPA Administrator Michael Regan delivers remarks in Ohio. (AP Photo/Matt Freed)""Case studies of the EJCPS Program have already found that grantees failed to clearly define health or environmental concerns, articulate intended results, identify causes, and continued to engage in activities that ‘may not be effective’ and did ‘not logically lead to the desired environmental and/or public health [result],’"" the lawmakers wrote to Regan.""Oversight mechanisms in these programs are lacking, and adequate metrics for applicants must be imposed to avoid funneling money into vague projects that will enable a $100 million slush fund for far-left organizations.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe Republicans noted that the EPA s budget has skyrocketed from $17.2 billion to $76.5 billion and said the agency must ensure waste is prevented as it doles out more federal funding than ever before. They wrote that, in addition to the grant programs its oversees, the increasing size of the EPA alone ""prompts review of the agency s ability to properly manage its rapidly inflated budget.""""American taxpayers deserve assurance that their dollars are dedicated to programs that are being protected from waste, fraud, and abuse,"" Fallon said in a statement.""Oversight Republicans will use all the tools at our disposal to make sure our government is held accountable for the spending-binge it conducted last Congress, and that government agencies who received taxpayer dollars are meeting their missions,"" he added.The EPA didn t immediately respond to a request for comment.Thomas Catenacci is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.SubscribedYou ve successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

We re entering an era which is similar to Joe McCarthy back when he was red-baiting in the State Department and attacking communism, and a little bit like Hitler in the  30s,"" Baucus said.""Now in the United States, if anybody says anything reasonable about China, he or she feels intimidated, worried his head is going to be chopped off.

17,GOP targets billions in COVID fraud with new bill: ‘Greatest heist of American taxpayer dollars in history’,"   Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram on the House Oversight Committee s investigation into COVID fraud on  Special Report. Top Republicans in the House are hoping to recover billions of dollars in wasted taxpayer funds by paying states to claw back fraudulent COVID-era unemployment benefits that went to scammers instead of people in need.The bill comes just weeks after a federal watchdog testified that ""at least"" $191 billion was wasted on fake COVID unemployment claims. That finding followed a call from President Biden in his State of the Union address to ""prosecute criminals who stole relief money"" during COVID, a sign that the GOP has a chance of becoming law this year.Despite Biden’s call, one sponsor of the bill, House Ways and Means Commtitee Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., said the Biden administration has done little to back up Biden’s words and that the Republican House needs to act.FEDS WASTED ‘AT LEAST’ $191 BILLION ON FAKE COVID UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS, SAYS LABOR DEPARTMENT WATCHDOGRep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., proposed a bill aimed at recovering lost COVID unemployment funds. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) ""At a time when Americans were suffering from government lockdowns, hundreds of billions were being stolen from those in need,"" Smith said. ""Yet the Biden Administration has ignored the rampant identity theft and fraud that’s left these people devastated.""""It has kept itself and the American people in the dark about the size and scope of unemployment fraud that was stolen during COVID,"" he said. ""House Republicans are now turning on the lights after raising the alarm about this greatest theft of tax dollars in American history.""Another sponsor, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., said COVID theft ""may be the greatest heist of American taxpayer dollars in history.""‘NO EVIDENCE  CHINA SURVEILLANCE FLIGHTS WERE USED TO SPREAD COVID, SAYS HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE MEMBERRepublicans say President Biden didn t do enough to stop COVID unemployment fraud. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)The two committee chairmen said some estimates say as much as $400 billion in fraudulent unemployment payments may have been made during the COVID pandemic, during which nearly $900 billion in relief payments went out.Under their bill, state workforce agencies that manage federal unemployment benefits would be incentivized to pursue fraudulent claims – they would keep 25% of everything they recover, and let them use it at the state level to improve unemployment insurance integrity by hiring fraud investigators, boosting ID verification and other steps.In early February, the Department of Labor’s Office of Inspector General told Smith’s committee that at least $191 billion in COVID unemployment benefits were lost to fraud, and likely more. That report said COVID created a ""perfect storm"" for fraud, as people were allowed to self-certify that they were eligible to receive Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), which went to millions of people who were not traditionally eligible for unemployment benefits.CALIFORNIA, NEW YORK, ILLINOIS USED COVID-19 RELIEF FUNDS TO PUSH CRT IN SCHOOLSA Labor Department watchdog said at least $191 billion was lost to fraud. (Tom Williams)""The reliance solely on claimant self-certifications without evidence of eligibility and wages during the program’s first 9 months rendered the PUA program extremely susceptible to improper payments, including fraud,"" Inspector General Larry Turner said.The OIG found that the improper payment rate for unemployment insurance was about 10% before COVID but jumped to roughly double that during COVID.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOther witnesses at Smith’s committee said state workforce agencies weren’t prepared to handle the rush of COVID-related claims, which contributed to fraud.Pete Kasperowicz is a politics editor at Fox News Digital.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.SubscribedYou ve successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

21,China unleashes massive coal power expansion despite John Kerry's climate pleas,"   Senior Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the House GOP investigation on whether Biden climate envoy John Kerry s discussions with China might undermine the U.S. economy and foreign policy.China unleashed a massive expansion of coal power generation last year despite pleas from Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and Western governments for the nation to take more climate action, according to an independent analysis released Monday.China permitted a whopping 106 gigawatts of new coal power capacity in 2022, roughly quadrupling the amount permitted in 2021, the analysis published by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) and Global Energy Monitor showed. The new generation is equal to about 100 large coal-fired power plants.""China continues to be the glaring exception to the ongoing global decline in coal plant development,"" Global Energy Monitor analyst Flora Champenois said in a statement. ""The speed at which projects progressed through permitting to construction in 2022 was extraordinary, with many projects sprouting up, gaining permits, obtaining financing and breaking ground apparently in a matter of months.""""This kind of a process leaves little room for proper planning or consideration of alternatives,"" Champenois added.JOHN KERRY S SECRET CCP NEGOTIATIONS PROBED BY GOP OVERSIGHT CHAIRMANSmoke and steam rise from a coal processing plant in Shanxi Province, China, on Nov. 28, 2019. (AP Photo/Olivia Zhang, File)According to the American Geosciences Institute, burning coal produces more carbon emissions compared to burning any other fossil fuel. Coal power can have as much as twice the carbon footprint as natural gas.China already accounts for about 27% of total global emissions, according to Rhodium Group. The nation s emissions output are equivalent to triple the total of the U.S., which is the world s second-largest emitter.JOHN KERRY S OFFICE CONSULTED LEFT-WING ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS WHILE CRAFTING POLICIES, EMAILS SHOW""If China is going to meet its climate commitments, as we expect, these new coal power plants are going to end up as short-lived and under-utilized malinvestments,"" CREA lead analyst Lauri Myllyvirta said in a statement Monday.""To meet China’s goal of peaking CO2 emissions, the most urgent milestone is to scale up investments in clean power generation to cover all of power demand growth, which means declining demand for power generation from coal.""Although the Chinese government has expanded its renewable energy output in recent years, the report showed, it still mainly relies on coal power to meet its energy needs.The Biden administration has aimed to work with China on climate change policy. (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)The massive uptick in coal power generation comes as the U.S., led by Kerry, continues to push China to take climate action more seriously. Since assuming his position at the State Department in early 2021, Kerry has engaged in various private talks with Chinese counterparts, including two 2021 meetings that took place in China.However, Chinese officials cut off negotiations with Kerry last year in response to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi s, D-Calif., high-profile trip to Taiwan.BIDEN S ENERGY SECRETARY MET WITH CHINA-CONNECTED GROUP FUELING GAS STOVE BANS IN US""From day one, the United States has made clear that our climate engagement with the PRC should remain separate from the other tough issues our two countries face for a simple reason: We are the two largest economies and largest emitters, and the entire world will suffer the consequences if we don t, together, lead the way on climate action,"" Kerry told Fox News Digital in a statement in October.""The climate crisis is not a bilateral issue, it’s universal,"" he continued. ""It is not about geopolitics or ideology, and no country should withhold progress on existential transnational issues because of bilateral differences.""Kerry added that the human and financial costs ""will be catastrophic"" if nations don t put aside differences and address climate change.U.S. climate envoy John Kerry attends the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, on Nov. 12, 2021. Kerry s negotiations with China have stalled in recent months. (REUTERS/Yves Herman)And while China has pushed forward with fossil fuel power expansion, the U.S. and other Western countries have aimed to prematurely retire existing fossil fuel power infrastructure. The U.S. shut down 11.8 gigawatts of coal power generation in 2022, bringing the total capacity below 200 gigawatts, according to Energy Information Administration data.The U.S. is on track to have just 150 gigawatts of coal power capacity by 2029, the data showed. The large-scale retirements have sparked concerns among electric grid watchdogs and experts who have warned the grid may become unstable with so much power coming offline.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""Parts of the North American bulk power system face resource capacity or energy risks as early as the summer of 2023,"" the North American Electric Reliability Corporation stated in a report in December.""Capacity deficits, where they are projected, are largely the result of generator retirements that have yet to be replaced,"" it continued.

A Congressman representing East Palestine, Ohio is slamming Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg after he shifted a portion of the blame for a derailed train carrying toxic chemicals to the Trump administration as well as Congress.Buttigieg said on Tuesday that his agency has been ""constrained"" by the Trump administration, stating that the Department of Transportation in 2018 withdrew a proposed rule that would require trains carrying some dangerous chemicals to use electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brakes.At the time, the Department of Transportation said that the technology s benefits weren t conclusive.""We’re constrained by law on some areas of rail regulation (like the braking rule withdrawn by the Trump administration in 2018 because of a law passed by Congress in 2015), but we are using the powers we do have to keep people safe,"" Buttigieg tweeted.OHIO REPUBLICAN INVITES BUTTIGIEG TO EAST PALESTINE TOWN HALL AFTER TRAIN DERAILMENT:  I LL SAVE A SEAT Rep.

30,Prep school rape case from 2014 comes back to haunt Biden's latest troubled nominee,"   During an episode of  The Verdict,  Sen. Ted Cruz argued that James Clapper intended to minimize the impact of the New York Post s Hunter Biden laptop story in the weeks before the 2020 presidential election.One of President Biden s judicial nominees faced brutal questioning Wednesday during a Senate confirmation hearing for the role he played in defending a New Hampshire prep school in a famous student rape case from 2014 — a role that could scuttle his nomination.In a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, GOP senators grilled Michael Arthur Delaney, who is nominated to serve on a First Circuit court, for his role as defense attorney for the elite St. Paul’s School in Concord, New Hampshire, during the case against Owen Lambrie. When he was 18, Lambrie was accused of raping a 15-year-old student, Chessy Prout.The contention in the hearing stemmed from a motion that Delaney filed during the 2014 court proceedings that could have required Prout, who was a minor at the time, to have her anonymity lifted.""You filed a motion that sought to strip her anonymity,"" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., charged in the hearing.""You told the court that it should happen because you didn’t like the time at which her counsel filed their complaint because it put your school at an inconvenience. They had to answer reporter questions, you said. Frankly, that seems to me like a small burden to bear after what Chessy went through,"" he said.CRUZ SLAMS BIDEN FCC PICK FOR DONATING TO SENATORS DURING HER NOMINATION PROCESS:  I VE NEVER SEEN THAT Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. ()""I’m astounded you’ve been nominated. I can’t believe we’re sitting here having this conversation today,"" Hawley added. ""People who put sexual assault victims through this kind of torture shouldn’t sit on the bench.""Delaney defended his position by saying the motion he filed was in the context of a back-and-forth between lawyers about whether Prout could stay anonymous and whether Prout s legal team would agree to not discuss the case in the press. He said it was not ""in any way intended to intimidate any of the parties to the case."" The motion was ultimately withdrawn, and Prout chose to come forward publicly on her own.But Republicans rejected that explanation.""You made a decision here… to try to strip a young girl of her anonymity. And you effectively succeeded, because you bullied her into it,"" Hawley claimed. ""So she, unwilling to be intimidated by you, went forward and revealed her own name.""BIDEN S JUDICIAL NOMINEE RELEASED MAN WHO WAS LATER INVOLVED IN MURDER OF 10-YEAR-OLD AT JULY 4TH COOKOUTMichael Delaney, a Biden administration nominee to serve on a First Circuit court, was grilled by GOP senators in a February 15, 2023 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. (Fox News/screenshot)Prout submitted a letter to committee opposing Delaney’s nomination, from which Hawley read excerpts aloud.""I remember so clearly reading Michael Delaney s motion from front to back when I came home from my new high school one day, processing what it meant,"" Hawley read from the letter. ""And then defiantly stating to my parents that after everything I ve been dragged through from anonymous death and rape threats on the internet, to the betrayal of and backlash of my closest friends. I wasn t gonna let Michael Delaney’s dirty tactics bully me – then 16 years old – into shame and silence.""""When survivors of sexual assault, harassment and abuse come forward to seek some semblance of justice, there is an army of attorneys with a tried and true playbook of tactics to discredit, pressure and manipulate survivors and victims into silence,"" Hawley read from the letter.Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas., noted that Prout’s parents were in the audience at the hearing.""You and your daughter have been victimized now three times,"" Cruz said. ""First on that horrific night. Secondly, when Mr. Delaney representing the school went into court, and tried to strip your daughter s anonymity, tried to out her against her wishes. And third, when the Biden administration chose to reward him by nominating him to the court of appeals.""SEN. JOSH HAWLEY PROPOSES LEGAL AGE TO ALLOW KIDS ON SOCIAL MEDIACruz added that ""there is a reason that virtually every Democrat skipped this hearing. They’re embarrassed about this nomination."" At least seven committee Democrats were not present at the hearing.Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. (Eric Lee/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Cruz read another portion of Prout’s letter, which said, ""If Michael Delaney is confirmed, if an attorney who has brazenly intimidated a minor victim of sexual assault is given the distinct privilege to serve as a judge for the United States Court of Appeals, you are telling victims and survivors that you not only approve of victim intimidation tactics, you reward their enactors with one of the highest legal appointments in the state of Massachusetts.""CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDelaney said that he hopes the committee will ""consider the totality"" of his 30-year career for his nomination.""Ihavespentnearly30yearsinmylegalcareer, halfofthatinpublicservice,"" he said.""InallthatIdid,Iwouldaskthiscommitteetoconsiderthetotalityofmyrecordovernearly30yearsasitreviewsmyqualifications,"" Delaney added.In a statement to Fox News Digital, White House spokesperson Seth Schuster said, ""former New Hampshire Attorney General Delaney has a strong track record of upholding the rule of law, including taking action to protect vulnerable victims,"" adding that Delaney has ""worked alongside advocates to create New Hampshire’s first network of Sexual Assault Response Teams and a multi-disciplinary commission on human trafficking, and was recognized by the New Hampshire Governor’s Commission on Domestic and Sexual Violence for outstanding commitment to collaborative multi-disciplinary efforts to reduce family violence in New Hampshire.""""The White House has the utmost respect for sexual assault and domestic violence survivors, and expects Senators to take Mr. Delaney’s full record into account when considering his nomination – as the White House did before nominating Mr. Delaney to the First Circuit,"" Schuster said.Brianna Herlihy is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.SubscribedYou ve successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

41,Hochul proposes further overhaul to New York's controversial bail reform laws,"   Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what s clicking on Foxnews.com.New York Gov. Kathy Hochul introduced a proposal to yet again revise the state’s controversial bail reform law as budget negotiations are expected to be underway for the next several weeks. The plan marks the third time changes would be made to the state’s bail reform laws, which eliminated cash bail and mandated release for most misdemeanor and nonviolent offenses since its introduction in 2019 under Hochuls  predecessor, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo.As part of her $227 billion total budget proposal for the 2024 fiscal year, Hochul aims to restore ""judicial discretion in securing order determinations by removing the least restrictive means standard.""Last week, the governor said judges have given feedback expressing a lack of clarity on the law.Her latest proposal would allow judges to consider a defendant’s ""activities and history,"" past criminal convictions, past use or possession of a firearm and financial circumstances, as well as whether the charges include allegations of causing serious harm, when setting bail, the New York Daily News reported.KATHY HOCHUL CLAIMS CASHLESS BAIL DOES NOT IMPACT CRIME, CNN HOST AGREES: ‘NO EVIDENCE’New York Gov. Kathy Hochul presented her executive state budget in Albany, NY, on Feb. 1, 2023. She aims to revise the state bail reform laws a third time. (AP Photo/Hans Pennink)Language on bail reform already negotiated into the state budget last year gave judges more discretion to set bail for repeat offenders and in cases involving guns and protection order violations.Hochul received staunch criticism for her support for cashless bail measures, which Republicans like former congressman Lee Zeldin and even Democratic New York City Mayor Eric Adams tied to rising recidivism rates and violent crime.New York City Mayor Eric Adams and the NYPD have blamed cashless bail laws for rising recidivism rates of offenders repeatedly arrested and rearrested. (PMichael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Hochul narrowly defeated Zeldin in the November gubernatorial race, and Zeldin is expected to host a press conference in Albany Monday on the governor’s budget proposal.The Democratic governor is now receiving pushback from the left for becoming more open than before to bail reform tweaks. Assemblywoman Latrice Walker, a Democrat from Brooklyn, argued that nixing the least restrictive standard will ""send more Black and brown people to jail pretrial without enhancing public safety.""State Sen. Jessica Ramos, a Democrat who represents Queens, gave a frosty response to the bail proposal.""I am not keen on budging on any of the bail reform work that we have done,"" Ramos said. ""It is incomplete work and I am hoping that the response is to actually build the mental healthcare facilities that we need so New Yorkers who are engaging in harm-doing can actually receive the services and given the treatment that they deserve.""Yet, Republicans and Adams maintain bail reform is contributing to offenders being repeatedly arrested and released while awaiting trial until their offenses often become more dangerous. NYPD officials have spoken out against bail reform in legislative sessions, citing statistics showing thousands of individuals have gone on to commit a violent felony after being released. (Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images)NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey spoke to the matter at a join legislative session last week evaluating crime statistics and data collection.He argued the previous changes made last year to the state bail reform law fell short in addressing repeat offenders, pointing to data showing some 2,000 individuals have gone on to commit a violent felony after being released in recent years.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""An even larger number of people with a recent persistent pattern go on to commit other crimes,"" Maddrey added, according to Daily News.

The State of the Union address will also allow the president to make an early pitch for re-election, should he decide to run again in 2024.However, that too may be a tough pitch — even among his own base.Indeed, a striking 62% of Democrats don t want Biden to run for re-election, compared to just 37% who want to see him seek a second term, according to a new Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe new survey came one day after the ABC News/Washington Post poll found that by a 58-31% margin, Democrats want their party to nominate someone other than Biden to be their 2024 presidential nominee.The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital s request for comment.Aaron Kliegman is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.SubscribedYou ve successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

The attorney general alleged that the regulation violates federal law, fails to consider the state s conservation measures and would prove to be onerous for state property owners.""I will not tolerate the Biden Administration’s efforts to run roughshod over the property rights of Texans and to stop our conservation efforts aimed at protecting Texas wildlife,"" Paxton said in a statement.""This rule was a targeted attempt to implement an unlawful, top-down federal approach aimed at advancing a radical environmentalist agenda, which would crush the type of economic development that aids in providing funds for conservation,"" he continued. ""This isn’t going to fly in Texas.""NEARLY 200 GOP LAWMAKERS BLAST BIDEN S EPA FOR TARGETING FARMERS, RANCHERS:  EGREGIOUS FEDERAL OVERREACH Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton speaks outside the Supreme Court on Nov. 1, 2021. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images)According to a release from Paxton s office, the Endangered Species Act requires the FWS to take a series of steps, including conducting an impact study and considering a wide range of variables, before classifying a species as threatened or endangered. Such federal requirements were never taken before listing the Lesser Prairie-Chicken, according to Paxton.The rule also threatens ""considerable conservation efforts"" that stakeholders, led by Texas, private landowners and private groups, have already put in place to protect the chicken species.""Combining this disregard for federal law, the overly vague nature of the rule, and the failure to abide by the legally-required notice of proposed rulemaking, the new rule constitutes yet another example of the Biden Administration’s willingness to prioritize executive overreach over state-directed management and conservation of wildlife and natural resources,"" Paxton s office stated.FARMERS SLAM BIDEN OVER LATEST ECO REGULATION TARGETING BUSINESSES:  FEDERAL OVERREACH Last week, Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach similarly announced that he would sue the Biden administration over the rule, saying it was illegal and would have a ""devastating impact on Kansas ranchers, Kansas oil producers, and Kansas wind farms.""In November, the FWS, a DOI subagency tasked with managing the nation s wildlife populations and habitats, announced that it would list the Lesser Prairie-Chicken after a ""rigorous review of the best available scientific and commercial information.""""The lesser prairie-chicken’s decline is a sign our native grasslands and prairies are in peril.

(Michael Pearce/Wichita Eagle/MCT via Getty Images)The listing sparked concerns among lawmakers, farmers and energy developers that the listing — which effectively locks up millions of acres across five states to protect the species — could negatively impact business. The Texas-based Permian Basin Petroleum Association previously won a lawsuit against the FWS during the Obama administration arguing that a rule protecting the chicken didn t properly factor in local conservation efforts.Tens of millions of dollars have been spent in recent years to protect the species, the group s president said at the time.BIDEN EPA PROPOSES REGULATION THAT FARMERS WARN WILL DRIVE FOOD PRICES HIGHER""The Biden Administration has chosen to continue their assault on Texas energy and agriculture producers by classifying the lesser prairie-chicken as an endangered species. This decision will wreak havoc on our local and state economies and make it even harder to produce oil & gas in the midst of an energy and economic crisis,"" said Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.""President Biden needs to get out of the business of over-regulating and focus on unleashing American energy dominance,"" he added. ""The federal government must do so in a balanced manner through ongoing local and state conservation efforts. We can protect important species without devastating our local and rural communities.""Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, accused President Biden of ""over-regulating"" in response to the chicken species designation. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)In response to pressure from industry groups, state officials and lawmakers like Pfluger, the FWS delayed implementation of the rule from late January to March 27, 2023.

However, the Heritage authors argue that, with the encouragement of Mayorkas  words and policies, the system is being exploited by millions of economic migrants who may be fleeing hardship but do not meet the bar of asylum.Soaring asylum cases have led to a record years-long backlog in U.S. immigration courts.Due to an overwhelming number of illegal immigrants entering the country, well over 50% of agents are often pulled off guarding the 1,954-mile U.S.-Mexico border to process, care for, and transfer migrants, leaving huge gaps for cartels and smugglers to exploit, according to former top border security officials.The result, Heritage warns, is a national security threat and humanitarian crisis.Under Mayorkas, about 1.2 million illegal immigrant ""gotaways"" are known to have evaded U.S. authorities, according to border agents. Experts are especially concerned about this group since Border Patrol encountered 98 migrants on the Terrorist Screening Dataset between the legal ports of entry in fiscal year 2022. The first three months of fiscal year 2023 have already encountered 38. By comparison, the figures were 16 and three for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.Migrant families wade through shallow waters after being delivered by smugglers on small inflatable rafts on U.S. soil in Roma, Texas, on March 24, 2021. (AP Photo/Dario Lopez-Mills)NEARLY 300,000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SLIPPED PAST BORDER AGENTS IN LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS: SOURCESBeyond security, Heritage outlines how Mexican cartels have used the border crisis to push drugs and human trafficking operations into the U.S., noting the victims are often children and young adults.Last month, in a highly public case, an illegal immigrant was charged in the rape and murder of a 20-year-old with autism.The Heritage report argues such outcomes are the results of purposeful policy decisions by Mayorkas that are often in contravention to written law.""He s ignored laws, outright violated laws, lied, subjected his own officers and employees to grave danger — it absolutely merits impeachment,"" said Ries. ""He s created threats to national security, public safety, and public health. And he s completely lost the trust of the American people.""An entire section of the report focuses on an alleged ""betrayal of the public trust,"" listing several examples of Mayorkas telling Congress and the country that the border is secure despite the ongoing border crisis.The report also says Mayorkas ""withheld"" and misrepresented"" information in several cases. Most notoriously, the DHS chief in 2021 promoted the narrative that border agents on horseback were whipping Haitian migrants trying to enter the U.S. after being told that no whipping took place.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas testifies before the House Judiciary Committee, on Capitol Hill, April 28, 2022. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)MAYORKAS ALERTED THAT NO HAITIAN MIGRANTS WERE ‘WHIPPED’ HOURS BEFORE WH PRESS CONFERENCE""The administration didn t want bad optics, so they came up with this bogus story,"" said Ries. ""Mayorkas has yet to apologize for lying. It created incredible damage for his own employees.""Fox News Digital reached out to the Department of Homeland Security seeking comment for this story.""Secretary Mayorkas is proud to advance the noble mission of this department, support its extraordinary workforce, and serve the American people,"" a DHS spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""The department will continue our work to enforce our laws and secure our border, while building a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system.""The spokesperson also referred Fox News Digital to a recent DHS press release, touting how illegal border crossings between ports of entry have dropped since President Biden last month announced ""additional border enforcement measures to limit illegal immigration.""According to Ries, however, the changes were a ""shell game"" not reducing the numbers but shifting them from Border Patrol agents between ports of entry to officials at the ports.Critics have argued the efforts to impeach Mayorkas is politically motivated and not constitutionally sound, claiming it is based on accusations of dereliction of duty to target political opponents rather than the legal threshold of ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" described in the Constitution.""The Republicans who support his impeachment know full well that they cannot succeed in removing him by a two-thirds Senate vote. But they still want to impeach him, in order to highlight the alleged failures of this administration in controlling the southern border,"" legal expert Alan Dershowitz wrote in a New York Daily News op-ed over the weekend. ""They may have enough Republican votes to achieve this unconstitutional political goal, despite the fact that some Republican moderates seem unwilling to go along with this charade … Both parties are willing to weaponize the constitutional criteria for impeachment in order to achieve political benefits.""Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, gang members wait to be escorted upon their arrival at the maximum-security jail in Zacatecoluca, El Salvador, Oct. 12, 2017. (Reuters/Jose Cabezas)MARYLAND MOM CALLS FOR MAXIMUM SENTENCE FOR TEEN MS-13 GANG MEMBER CHARGED WITH DAUGHTER S MURDERWhen asked to respond to such claims, von Spakovsky argued the case against Mayorkas has nothing to do with politics.""You can t impeach someone because of policy differences — that s political and not grounds for impeachment,"" he said. ""You impeach someone for breaking their oath of office to enforce the laws for which their department is responsible. No one can in any way deny that Mayorkas has been blatantly violating immigration law.""""They can claim it s political,"" he continued. ""But I think we make a very careful case. It s Mayorkas  job to enforce the laws whether he likes them or not.""The report notes various authorities that have deemed failure to carry out the duties of one s office and ""behaving in a manner grossly incompatible with the proper functions and purpose of the office"" as constitutional grounds for impeachment, among others.Heritage s report came after Republican lawmakers last week filed a second resolution in less than a month that would impeach Mayorkas.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDespite such efforts, however, at least one Heritage author sees the GOP actually going soft on securing the border now that the midterm elections are over and doesn t want Mayorkas to slide as a result.""We wanted to explain why this is warranted for Mayorkas to be impeached — to remind people of the lies he s told, the laws he s violated, and the damage he s caused to the country and will continue to be caused if he remains secretary,"" Ries told Fox News Digital.Aaron Kliegman is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.SubscribedYou ve successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

Check out what s clicking on Foxnews.com.With state savings accounts and revenue collections at all-time highs, tax cuts are expected to be a top priority for Gov. Kevin Stitt and the Republican-controlled Legislature when it begins the 2023 session on Monday.Stitt, who easily won reelection in November, will present his executive budget proposal to lawmakers and deliver his fifth State of the State address at noon to a joint legislative session.The governor last year urged the House and Senate to send him bills to eliminate the state sales tax on groceries and reduce the individual and corporate income tax rates, but none of those proposals made it into law. All of those are expected to be part of the budget negotiations again this year.After the Federal Reserve enacted another interest rate hike, last week Stitt tweeted that ""we need to cut taxes and that starts with eliminating our state’s grocery tax.""OKLAHOMA AG APOLOGIZES FOR FORMER STATE CABINET SECRETARY S INDICTMENTOklahoma currently has about $1.4 billion in its constitutional Rainy Day Fund and a separate revenue stabilization fund, and the amount of money available for lawmakers to spend on this year s budget is expected to increase by another $950 million, based on December figures approved by the state Board of Equalization.Oklahoma Gov.

Adam Pugh, the chairman of the Senate Education Committee, unveiled a plan last month to give an across-the-board teacher pay raise of between $3,000 and $6,000, based on years of service. But the governor s Secretary of Education and new State Superintendent Ryan Walters has put forth a plan to give merit-based pay raises to teachers.OKLAHOMA AG S OFFICE CONFIRMS IT WILL TAKE OVER 2 CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS REGARDING THE MISUSE OF PUBLIC FUNDSThe Legislature also is likely to consider again a plan endorsed by Stitt and Walters for a voucher-style plan to divert public education funds from public schools to private schools, although the proposal remains unpopular with many House Republicans, particularly those in rural areas.A number of bills also have been introduced by Republicans this year to restore some of the abortion restrictions that were imposed last year, including a bill that would allow abortions in cases of rape or incest that have been reported to law enforcement and clarifying the definition of when an abortion is allowed in cases of medical emergencies that threaten the life of the mother.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""That bill is supported and endorsed by Oklahomans for Life, so I would anticipate (it) has a chance of passing,"" said Rep.

Republicans on Capitol Hill have demanded a closer look at Biden s decision-making throughout last week, which saw the Chinese balloon cross the entire continental United States before being shot down.House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., also requested a Gang of Eight meeting on the balloon this weekend.Democrats in Congress have praised Biden s handling of the incident, however, arguing that waiting to shoot down the craft over water was the safest option.

52,"DeSantis, Florida Republican leaders to consider expanding migrant flight program during special session","   Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis reacted Tuesday to criticism of his state flying migrants to Martha s Vineyard in Massachusetts. (WTVT)Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is expected to use a special session this week to broaden the state’s migrant flight program after transporting some 50, mostly Venezuelan, migrants to Martha’s Vineyard last year, sparking uproar in the wealthy, liberal Massachusetts enclave that touted support for sanctuary policies. Republican leaders of the legislature, in coordination with DeSantis on Friday, ordered lawmakers to convene for a special session this week to consider legislation creating what would be known as the Unauthorized Alien Transport Program. Other items on the agenda include dealing with Disney’s self-governing Reedy Creek Improvement District as well as the prosecution of election crimes.""The Legislature finds that the U.S. Government has failed to secure the nation’s border and has allowed a surge of unauthorized aliens to enter the United States in violation of the law,"" according to the governor’s budget recommendation. ""This crisis has brought detrimental effects including crime, drug trafficking and smuggling, diminished economic opportunities and wages for American workers, and burdens on the education and healthcare system. The federal government has proven itself unwilling to address this crisis. To mitigate the effects of this crisis on the state of Florida, there is hereby created the Unauthorized Alien Transport Program within the Department of Transportation for the purpose of facilitating the transport of inspected unauthorized aliens, within the United States, consistent with federal law.""RON DESANTIS SENDS TWO PLANES OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO MARTHA S VINEYARDFlorida Gov.

Jason Pizzo, a Miami Democrat, filed a lawsuit alleging DeSantis violated a spending provision requiring that those funds only be used for the removal of migrants from Florida.

53,IRS staff would be banned from telework under GOP bill until tax return backlog is eliminated,"   Managing partner of 8VC Joe Lonsdale joined  Fox & Friends  to discuss how the tax would affect America s most wealthy and why the state is a  total mess. Internal Revenue Service employees would be banned from telework under a new Republican bill until the IRS makes more progress on the millions of unprocessed tax returns that piled up during the COVID pandemic.The Require Employees To Uniformly Return Now (RETURN) Act, from Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Pa., would also prohibit the IRS from spending any more of the $80 billion it was allocated in the Inflation Reduction Act to hire tens of thousands of staff members over the next decade until the tax backlog is reduced.According to the agency’s own Taxpayer Advocate Service, the IRS had a backlog of more than 8 million individual and business paper returns as of late October 2022 that still needed to be processed. Meuser said there’s no reason IRS staff should be allowed to keep working from home until that backlog is cleared out.BILL TO ABOLISH THE IRS LIKELY DEAD IN THE HOUSE, GOP LAWMAKER PREDICTSA new bill from Rep. Dan Meuser would ban teleworking at the IRS until the tax return backlog is eliminated. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images | Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)""The bill is very much a response to the level of casework that my office… was receiving related to IRS refunds, returns and processing,"" he said. ""I hear almost regularly that refunds are months and months behind.""Meuser said in 2019, his office received 109 constituent requests for help with the IRS, a number that jumped to 637 in 2022 after more than two years since COVID hit.After investigating further, Meuser said he learned from the Biden administration that only about one-quarter of IRS officials had returned to full-time work in the office by the end of December 2022, months after President Biden said the pandemic was ""over.""Data his office received from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said more than 18,000 employees are still teleworking full time, and more than 61,000 of the agency’s staff are doing at least some telework. Meuser said the results of this relaxed employment policy can be seen in the delays and backlogs that taxpayers have been facing.IRS TARGETED POOREST TAXPAYERS WHILE MILLIONAIRES WENT MOSTLY UNSCATHED IN 2022: REPORTRep. Dan Meuser said the IRS needs to return to its former pace of work before spending more money on staffing. (Reuters/Al Drago) ""The results of this is really the problem,"" Meuser said. ""The backlog of processing is 8.7 million between refunds and other processing demands of taxpayers."" He added that at the end of 2019, before COVID hit, the backlog was less than 250,000.Meuser said the Democrats’ plan is to give the IRS billions more in funding to boost staffing, but he said he believes it makes more sense to require IRS staff to return to work and return to its prior level of productivity instead of allowing the IRS to hire more employees who get to work from home.In March 2020, at the start of the COVID pandemic, the IRS ""strongly encouraged"" telework-eligible staff to work from home. By May 2022, the IRS started calling all employees back to the office who didn’t have a telework agreement in place.SNOOP SCOOP: NEW GOP BILL WOULD PUT STOP TO IRS  $600 ONLINE REPORTING REQUIREMENTOnly a quarter of IRS staff had returned full time to the office as of December 2022, according to data received by Meuser s office.

A report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said about 25,000 IRS employees were allowed to telework before the pandemic, a number that jumped to 65,000 at the height of the pandemic.And late last year, the IRS indicated an interest in expanding telework options for staff.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""The IRS is really trying to step out in front of everyone else on telework, and we’re really impressed with them,"" Chad Hooper, president of the Professional Managers Association which represents IRS managers, told Federal News Network last year.The union that represents Treasury Department workers has also suggested that the lingering presence of COVID is another reason to allow extended telework opportunities for IRS staff.Pete Kasperowicz is a politics editor at Fox News Digital.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.SubscribedYou ve successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

Chip Roy, R-Texas, discusses House Republicans  efforts to address the crisis at the border. He also discusses the latest discovery of classified documents and Democrats  growing frustration.After Republicans at the state level have advanced dozens of bills to ban the teaching of critical race theory and other so-called ""divisive concepts"" in schools, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, is spearheading a federal effort to get ""racist teaching"" out of K-12 classrooms.Roy on Thursday will introduce the Combating Racist Teaching in Schools Act – called the CRT Act for short – which would block federal funding from elementary or secondary schools that promote ""race-based theories"" generally attributed to CRT.The bill comes in response to reports of schools teaching concepts that Republicans and parents have lambasted as racist. In March last year, parents at a school in San Antonio, Texas, expressed outrage after their children were segregated into two groups by their hair color and treated differently as part of an ""antiracism"" lesson. In 2021, school choice activist Christopher Rufo called attention to a report of third-graders in Cupertino, California, being instructed on how the ""dominant culture"" in America"" is ""White,"" ""cisgender"" and ""Christian,"" among other traits.Numerous other examples of such lessons have prompted states like Georgia and Florida to take action to ban CRT. Critics say these efforts have a chilling effect on free speech in the classroom, but Roy s bill contains an explicit provision that states, ""nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict the speech of a student, teacher or any other individual outside of a school setting.""

56,CO lawmakers look into artificial intelligence to identify wildfires early,"   Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what s clicking on Foxnews.com.A year after the most destructive wildfire in the state s history scorched nearly 1,100 homes, Colorado lawmakers are considering joining other Western states by adopting artificial intelligence in hopes of detecting blazes before they burn out of control.A proposal that legislators will discuss in a hearing Thursday would create a $2 million pilot program to mount cameras on mountaintops in high-risk locations. An artificial intelligence program developed by a private company would analyze the images and sounds from cameras with 10-mile radiuses in hopes of detecting something that could signal the start of a blaze.It is part of an ongoing effort by firefighters to use new technology to become smarter in how they prepare and better position their resources. Fire lookout towers once staffed by humans have largely been replaced with cameras in remote areas, many of them in high-definition and armed with artificial intelligence to discern a smoke plume from morning fog.REPUBLICAN SENATOR UNVEILS BILLS TARGETING BIDEN S CLIMATE AGENDA:  ENERGY IS THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY There are hundreds of such cameras scattered across California, Nevada and Oregon, and even casual viewers can remotely watch wildfires in real time.A historic drought and recent heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the American West and scientists say warming weather will continue to make fires more frequent and destructive. Record-breaking storms that drenched California with more than 11 inches of rain in recent weeks and big snow dumps in other states have improved conditions in the short-term, but the drought persists across most of Nevada, California and Utah, and large areas of other Western states, according to a Tuesday report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.A helicopter drops water on flames from the Alturas Fire on May 12, 2022. (Jerilee Bennett/The Gazette via AP, File)The goal with the Colorado program is for cameras and an AI algorithm to detect a plume of smoke and alert first responders who can stomp out the blaze before it grows, said Don Coram, a former Republican Colorado state senator who first backed the idea and encouraged this year s sponsor, Rep. Cleave Simpson, a Republican and rancher.""Once these fires get into cresting in the tree tops, it’s going to take a lot of resources, a lot of manpower, and a lot of good luck to knock them down,"" Coram said.Thursday s hearing will include testimony from a AI wildfire detection company called Pano AI.

Everything from redistricting to abortion rights to election laws heading into the 2024 presidential election and after in the swing state could be determined by the court.The court has the final word on hotly contested issues in the state because of conflicts between Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and the Republican-controlled Legislature. The court has overwhelmingly sided with Republicans on major policy issues over the past decade-plus.The race has become increasingly partisan, with both sides promising to spend millions on the contest in the battleground state. The candidates, particularly Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Janet Protasiewicz, have also been more outspoken than usual for a judicial race in stating their positions on issues that could come before the court.Protasiewicz launched the promotional spots that are running statewide as part of a $700,000 ad buy leading up to the Feb. 21 primary election.

Katie Hobbs on Wednesday announced the creation of a commission to study problems in Arizona’s prisons, including staffing levels and the health care offered to those behind bars.The creation of the commission by Hobbs, Arizona’s first Democratic governor since 2009, came several days after she ordered a separate r eview of the state’s death penalty protocols.""We cannot deny there is an urgent need to provide transparency and accountability in Arizona corrections system,"" Hobbs said.NM GOV. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM VOWS BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO FIGHT CRIMEThe commission will examine inmate access to food, medicine and sanitary products; whether prison staffing levels are adequate; conditions of the prisons, including security measures and whether they are crowded; rehabilitation and education programs for prisoners; and access to medical and mental health care and drug treatment programs.David Fathi, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who represents Arizona prisoners who challenged the quality of health care behind bars, applauded the establishment of the commission.After a federal judge concluded that Arizona provided inadequate health care to its inmates, Gov. Katie Hobbs decided to create a commission to study the state’s prison problems. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin, File)He said previous governors took a hands-off approach to prisons. ""They were disengaged and uninvolved,"" Fathi said. ""Gov. Hobbs seems to be charting a very different course.""Last summer, a federal judge concluded Arizona had violated the rights of incarcerated people in state-run prisons by providing them with inadequate health care — and that the state’s failures had led to preventable deaths.Before the trial in that case, U.S. District Judge Roslyn Silver threw out a settlement because the state wasn’t following through on many of the improvements to prisoner care it had promised to make. She concluded that $2.5 million in contempt of court fines against the state didn’t motivate it to comply with the settlement.AFTER CHESA BOUDIN, NEW SAN FRANCISCO DA CRACKS DOWN ON CRIME, BUT ANTI-COP VIEWS STALL PROGRESSIn late 2021, then-Corrections Director David Shinn testified that prisoners often have greater access to health services than people who aren’t locked up, leading Silver to later say that the claim was ""completely detached from reality.""The commission’s members will include four state lawmakers, two people who previously served time in Arizona prisons, a physician, a mental health professional and a family member of someone who served at least three years in Arizona prisons.Last week, Hobbs ordered a review of Arizona’s execution protocols, leading Kris Mayes, the state’s new Democratic attorney general, to hold off on seeking court orders to execute prisoners until the examination is completed.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe review was announced just days after the governor appointed Ryan Thornell, a prison official in Maine, as Arizona’s new corrections director.The review will examine, among other things, the state’s procurement process for lethal injection drugs and lethal gas, execution procedures, the access of news organizations to executions and the training of staff to carry out executions.Arizona currently has 110 prisoners on death row.

On three of the days he visited, multiple appointments appear in the forms.""Open Society is dedicated to advancing inclusive democracy and prosperity, and human rights, in the United States and around the world,"" an OSF spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""Our leadership, like our grantees, actively advocate with policymakers to advance these goals, and that includes engaging with policymakers from both parties.

(Photo by Astrid Riecken For The Washington Post via Getty Images)OSF did not answer questions on the nature of the meetings, and the White House did not respond to an inquiry on the matter. It remains unclear precisely who Perriello met with for the sessions, as the visitor logs often contain White House staff who book appointments, meet the guests and take them to other personnel.However, the records show that Jordan Finkelstein, the chief of staff to Biden senior adviser Anita Dunn, was one individual to greet Perriello. Richard Figueroa, a race and ethnicity policy adviser; Rachel Chiu, chief of staff in the office of political strategy and outreach; Yohannes Abraham, previously the deputy assistant to the president, chief of staff, and executive secretary of the National Security Council, also appear in the logs, among others.Perriello s proximity to the Biden administration further illustrates Soros  inner circle s close access to those who run the country. Soros  son Alex, who acts as OSF s chair, has scoredseveral meetings at the White House, including twice visiting Ron Klain, Biden s outgoing chief of staff. Alex has also publicly posted several pictures with his father and Democratic lawmakers, including Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, at what appear to be small, private gatherings.Perriello, meanwhile, is also involved with a left-wing outfit working to shift policy behind closed doors. He sits on the board of Governing for Impact (GFI), a once secretive group backed by millions of dollars from Soros that has quietly worked with the Biden administration on the policy items,Fox News Digital previously reported.BIDEN S TITLE IX PROPOSAL MIRRORS ACTION MEMO FROM SOROS-FUNDED GROUP PUSHING GENDER IDENTITY INTO RULESGeorge Soros, left, Rep.

Additionally, the Open Society Policy Center, Soros  advocacy nonprofit, sent $7.45 million to GFI s action fund during that time. Open Society-U.S., which Perriello leads, was the referring program for the grants.GFI s total contributions are unknown, but Soros  cash likely puts him among its top donors. The groups are not required to file tax forms to the Internal Revenue Service because they are fiscally sponsored projects of the New Venture Fund and Sixteen Thirty Fund, not standalone organizations.""Perriello s frequent lunch meetings at the White House are just more proof that Governing for Impact, and by extension George Soros, is secretly calling the shots on regulations that will affect the daily lives of millions,"" said the Capital Research Center s Parker Thayer, who initially discovered the group and alerted Fox News Digital.GEORGE SOROS  SON BECOMES KINGMAKER WITH TOP DEMS AS HE MAKES MULTIPLE BIDEN WH VISITS, MEETS WITH LAWMAKERSGeorge Soros previously lamented that then-President Obama had closed the door to him, drawing a stark contrast to the Biden administration.

Check out what s clicking on Foxnews.com.An Idaho lawmaker has introduced legislation that would ask voters to change the state’s constitution to make it harder to get initiatives on the ballot.Republican Sen. Doug Okuniewicz introduced the joint resolution Wednesday in the Senate State Affairs Committee. If approved, it would ask voters to change the Idaho Constitution so that lawmakers could reenact tougher ballot initiative rules that were thrown out by the Idaho Supreme Court in 2021.""Two years ago, we passed a law that was Senate Bill 1110, passed it overwhelmingly,"" Okuniewicz, of Hayden, told the committee.

68,How long can Kevin last? Here's what would have to happen for McCarthy to lose his job as House speaker,"   Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume reacts to the Congressional clash after House Speaker Kevin McCarthy blocked leading Democrats from committees on  Special Report. A day does not pass without someone posing the following question to me: ""How long is McCarthy going to last?""We are barely three weeks into the 118th Congress.House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., endured a protracted and heated floor election to become speaker earlier this month. McCarthy finally won over many of his skeptics, but not before making a key concession. It is called the ""motion to vacate the chair."" McCarthy’s opponents demanded that he make it easier for them to bounce the California Republican from the speakership if they do not like the job he is doing. In exchange, McCarthy foes would support his candidacy for speaker.For now.It is easy to see why the ""how long is McCarthy going to last"" question comes up a lot.MCCARTHY TUSSLES WITH REPORTER OVER INTEL COMMITTEE REMOVALS: ‘YOU HAVE NOT HAD THE BREIFING THAT I HAD’Kevin McCarthy is the Speaker of the House for the 118th Congress. (Jabin Botsford)The late Sen. and Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., once opined that he did not buy green bananas. That is because you never know if you will still be around to slice the bananas and broadcast them around your bowl of Grape-Nuts.A 60-pence head of lettuce purchased at Tesco famously (or, infamously) outlasted former British Prime Minister Liz Truss late last year. Truss lead the United Kingdom for only seven weeks. It marked the shortest tenure of any British Prime Minister.SEAN HANNITY: HOUSE SPEAKER KEVIN MCCARTHY REMOVED THESE ‘IDIOTS’ FOR GOOD REASONWe don’t need to measure the potential brevity of McCarthy’s tenure against the shelf-life of other green, leafy vegetables. But it’s fair to say that after finally prevailing on the 15th vote for speaker in the wee hours of Jan. 7, McCarthy is now enjoying the salad days of his speakership.McCarthy finally stemmed the uprising. However, his adversaries have now planted seeds of discontent and can use their dissatisfaction as a classic wedge against the speaker (bacon optional).Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy swears in the officers of the House of Representatives in the House Chamber of the U.S. Capitol Building on Saturday, Jan. 7, 2023 in Washington, D.C. (Kent Nishimura)The marathon speaker’s election may just be the tip of the iceberg for McCarthy.So, what does it take for someone to try to remove the speaker?Let me take you into the weeds.House Republicans ballyhooed their ""rules package"" for the 118th Congress. Adoption of the rules package — along with specific provisions — were critical to McCarthy’s ultimate success in the speaker’s vote.McCarthy’s one-time opponents demanded that the rules package make it easier for them to call for a new speaker’s vote in the middle of the Congress. However, you’d be hard-pressed to find much about the motion to ""vacate the chair"" in the rules package adopted by the House earlier this month.That’s because the rules package is silent on calling a no confidence vote for the Speaker.Previous Congresses crafted rules packages which established a number of members who must sign on to a resolution to demand a vote for Speaker in the middle of a Congress. As McCarthy campaigned for speaker, there was chatter about making the threshold of members to call for a new speaker election in the dozens. Then it dropped to five. Finally, McCarthy relented, lowering the bar to one.However, the House didn’t craft any special language about trying to evict the speaker in the rules package. It didn’t need to.Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy speaks during a news conference outside his office at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 24, 2023. McCarthy spoke on a range of issues, including committee assignments and Rep. George Santos. (Drew Angerer)Under standard procedure, any lawmaker may raise what’s called ""a question of privileges of the House."" Members only take such action a handful of times during a two-year Congress. Lawmakers take advantage of this privilege if they believe the reputation and integrity of the House are at stake or if someone has impugned their reputation or motives.In theory, a lawmaker could decide that the speaker is performing so poorly that the reputation of the House is at stake. So, a Member could possibly pose a question of privileges of the House, compelling the body to vote on whether to have another vote on the speakership. Under these terms, it takes a simple majority for the House to decide to have additional round of voting on the speaker. The question dies if a majority of members oppose it. It’s also possible the House could vote to table or kill or such an effort.SCHIFF, SWALWELL, OMAR RESPOND AFTER SPEAKER MCCARTHY KEEPS THEM OFF COMMITTEES: ‘POLITICAL VENGENCE’However, if a majority of House members vote to call for a new speaker, the speaker election is on. The process would begin anew — just like it did on Jan. 3.By rule, the House must continue to vote. And vote. And vote. Until it elects a speaker.The speaker election for McCarthy was the longest in the House since 1859.So, let’s dispel assumptions about the House voting again on speaker.A sole member cannot oust McCarthy if they aren’t satisfied with the job he’s doing, but one member can start the process. It then takes a simple majority to agree with the lone member and launch yet another round of roll call votes for speaker. The House uses the same rules to re-elect McCarthy or tap another speaker. The winner must secure an outright majority of members casting ballots for a candidate by last name.Rep. Kevin McCarthy won the vote for Speaker of the House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 7, 2023. (Nathan Posner)Here’s where this gets tricky.What happens if someone calls a vote when McCarthy doesn’t have the right combination of members in Washington who support him? That’s the risk. With such a slim majority, it’s possible the House could vote to call a new speaker election. The House could also elect someone besides McCarthy as speaker on a subsequent vote.It’s about the math.McCarthy can only lose five members on any given roll call vote from his side. Republicans are already playing down a man. Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., is out for several weeks after a bad fall at his home.So, you see the conundrum.The absence of language in the rules package about what’s required to depose a speaker also creates an opportunity for mischief.Republicans could have granted the option to try to take down the speaker to only Members of the majority. But the rules package is silent on this score. Thus, it’s possible (possible) that a mischievous Democrat could try to call for a speaker vote — just to wreak havoc in the House.MCCARTHY SAYS SANTOS WILL BE REMOVED FROM CONGRESS IF ETHICS COMMITTEE DETERMINES HE BROKE THE LAWIt’s not clear that Democrats would do this. Although there’s no love lost between Democrats and McCarthy, it’s far from certain that the Democratic brain trust would support one of their members creating mayhem about the speakership. Another speaker’s vote would bring all House activity to a standstill.An investigation is currently underway into several sets of classified documents found in President Biden s possession. (Susan Walsh)Then again, if things get dicey for President Biden and GOP investigations and the classified document issue, this gambit may be exactly what Democrats want.Congressional handicappers believe it’s inevitable that there will be some motion to oust McCarthy over the next two years, but it’s hard to gauge when that could come or under what circumstances.This isn’t exactly Shakespeare’s ""Julius Caesar"" where the knives are out for the speaker right now.CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPSo don’t start measuring the length of McCarthy’s speakership against cabbage.If there’s a new vote for speaker, it won’t be a Caesar Salad.

71,"WA Supreme Court to review state tax code, may overturn prohibition on income taxes","   Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what s clicking on Foxnews.com.An effort to balance what is considered the nation s most regressive state tax code comes before the Washington Supreme Court on Thursday, in a case that could overturn a prohibition on income taxes that dates to the 1930s.Washington is one of nine states without an income tax, and its heavy reliance on sales and fuel taxes to pay for schools, roads and other public expenses falls disproportionately on low-income residents.They pay at least six times more in taxes as a percentage of household income than the wealthiest residents do, according to lawmakers, and middle-income residents pay two to four times as much.HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO VOTE ON BILL ABOLISHING IRS, ELIMINATING INCOME TAXDemocrats in Olympia, led by Gov. Jay Inslee, sought to begin addressing that in 2021, when they enacted a 7% capital gains tax on the sale of stocks, bonds and other high-end assets, with exemptions for the first $250,000 each year and gains from sales of retirement accounts, real estate and certain small businesses.It was expected to be paid by 7,000 people — fewer than 1 in every 1,000 residents — and to bring in close to a half-billion dollars a year to help pay for public education in Washington, beginning this year. But it faces a legal challenge from wealthy residents and business and agricultural organizations, who say it violates the state and federal constitutions and makes for bad policy to boot.""Washington’s unique, unprecedented and unconstitutional tax on capital gains will discourage our state’s resident entrepreneurs and investors from investing in new and expanded businesses in our state,"" the Building Industry Association of Washington and Washington Retail Association wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief. ""It will also cause significant numbers of individual business owners to leave Washington to avoid the new tax.""Washington Supreme Court will review the state’s tax code in a case that may overturn a prohibition on income taxes. Pictured: The state Capitol is seen during a cloudy day in Olympia, Washington, on March 10, 2022. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File)Among the key issues being argued before the justices on Thursday is whether the new tax is, as the state insists, an excise tax — broadly defined as a tax on certain goods, services or activities — or an income tax, which the court long ago held unconstitutional in Washington.Voters overwhelmingly passed a graduated income tax in 1932. But in a 5-4 decision the following year, the state Supreme Court struck it down, ruling that a tax on income was a tax on property — and the state Constitution says property taxes must be uniform and limited to 1% per year.Last year, Douglas County Superior Court Judge Brian Huber in central Washington sided with those challenging the capital gains tax as a forbidden income tax. State Attorney General Bob Ferguson appealed, saying Huber got it wrong because the tax is not on property — it s on what an owner does with that property by selling it.IRS TARGETED POOREST TAXPAYERS WHILE MILLIONAIRES WENT MOSTLY UNSCATHED IN 2022: REPORTThe Edmonds School District and Washington Education Association, which intervened in the case on behalf of the state, said it agreed that the capital gains tax is an excise tax. But, they said, if the justices disagree and find that it is an income tax, then they should overturn their nearly century-old holding that an income tax is a tax on property.Unlike property, income isn t something that is owned and can be sold, their lawyers wrote: ""This Court’s cases holding that an income tax is a property tax were wrong when decided and they are wrong now.""The arguments come as progressives are making a push in several states to have the rich pay more in taxes. Bills announced this month in California, New York, Illinois, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, Washington and Connecticut all revolve around the idea that the richest Americans need to pay more. But the proposals all face questionable prospects.Those challenging Washington s capital gains tax say it might apply even if the taxpayer takes no action to generate their gains — in other words, they are taxed because they own the asset, not because they took any action regarding it.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFor example, a Washington resident who owns shares in an out-of-state company might benefit if the board of directors decides to sell major assets, with revenue passed on to shareholders, they wrote. In such a case the tax would be imposed based not on where the activity occurred, but where the shareholder lives, with implications regarding interstate commerce under the U.S. Constitution, they argued.They say the state s description of the measure as an excise tax is merely political maneuvering designed to conceal its true nature. The 41 states that tax capital gains tax it as income, they argue.Seven states have no income taxes at all — Washington, Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming — and two others, New Hampshire and Tennessee, tax only dividends and interest income earned by individual taxpayers.The challengers noted that since the 1930s, Washington s voters have 10 times rejected constitutional amendments or initiative measures that would allow or impose income taxes.""Whether the existing tax system is desirable or should be changed is a quintessential economic policy matter not appropriate for judicial resolution,"" they wrote.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.SubscribedYou ve successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

Retail crime also has been on the rise, with businesses losing millions of dollars to smash-and-grab schemes.Pointing to the recent mass shootings in California and past shootings in New Mexico, Lujan Grisham said no one should be fearful about sending their children to school or about going to work.

Michelle Lujan Grisham vowed to work with both Demoractic and Republican lawmakers to fight crime in New Mexico.

James Comer, R-Ky., chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, vowed Wednesday to ""get to the bottom"" of who is buying Hunter Biden’s art amid a wider probe into the first son’s foreign business dealings while his father was vice president.Fox News Digital previously reported that Georges Bergès, the art dealer representing Hunter Biden, has longstanding ties to China and said in 2015 that he wanted to be the art world s ""lead guy in China.""Comer responded to that comment on Wednesday, telling Fox News Digital that ""foreign adversaries, including China, have used transactions involving sham art sales to launder money and evade sanctions imposed by the United States.""""For decades, Hunter Biden has peddled influence and access to his father and engaged in shady business dealings with foreign adversaries around the world,"" Comer said.

87,"US more lenient on transgender treatment than Europe, study shows","   Caldwell School District mom Brittany Gish, her daughter Gianna and Idaho State GOP Sen. Chris Trakel express outrage over a proposed policy that allows biological boys in girls  locker rooms.EXCLUSIVE: The U.S. is more lenient than any European country when it comes to allowing children to access medical services for gender transitions, according to a new study.The study, published by Do No Harm, a group that seeks to insulate the health care profession from ""radical, diverse and discriminatory ideology,"" analyzed the laws of European countries and concluded ""the United States is the most permissive country when it comes to the legal and medical gender transition of children."" Laws vary in the U.S. by state, but overall, transgender youth in America have greater access to gender clinics, puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgeries, in some cases without parental consent.Dr. William Malone, a board-certified endocrinologist, said the U.S. political environment discourages doctors from critiquing the use of unproven and risky medical interventions in youth because they fear backlash from influential medical associations and politicians.""We are dealing with what may be the biggest medical and ethical scandal of modern times,"" Malone told Fox News Digital. ""Transgender medicine is big business, and youth who are transitioning today will be medical patients for life, for the next 60-plus years. Mental health among youth is at an all-time low, making them particularly vulnerable to solutions that suggest an ‘easy fix.’""BIDEN ADMINISTRATION FUNDS STUDIES ON DANGER OF TRANSGENDER HORMONAL TREATMENTS EVEN AS IT PUSHES THEM ON KIDSThe Biden administration has declared gender-affirming treatment to minors ""life-saving care."" (Associated Press)The Biden administration has declared gender-affirming treatment to minors to be ""life-saving care,"" while some Republican-led states that have tried to limit access face legal challenges to those decisions. Meanwhile, several European countries have backtracked on the accessibility of transgender treatments for minors, the study notes.The United Kingdom’s National Health Service last year announced it will close its only gender clinic for children and will move from an affirmation model to a focus on treating gender dysphoria with greater skepticism through psychotherapy. The country will discourage the use of social transitions in prepubescent children, and health services will require a wider range of medical input beyond gender experts, such as specialists in pediatrics, autism, neurodisability and mental health, before treating children for gender dysphoria.AMERICANS OVERWHELMINGLY OPPOSE TRANSGENDER ATHLETES IN FEMALE SPORTS, POLL SHOWSIn 2020, Finland announced it would deviate its approach to transgender youth from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) and use psychotherapy as the primary treatment for children with gender dysphoria.Sweden’s National Board of Health and Welfare updated guidelines in December to urge caution on transgender treatments for youth unless there is an ""exceptional"" case of gender dysphoria. The board said there is insufficient evidence on what caused the dramatic increase in dysphoria for teenage girls and cited instances of detransition as a concern.The French Academy of Medicine declared last year that more caution is needed to treat unprecedented increases in transgender youth and noted the challenge of identifying dysphoria as permanent or an adolescent phase.Some medical experts say transgender policy in the U.S. has become overly politicized. (Ricardo Ramirez Buxeda/Orlando Sentinel/Tribune News Service via Getty Images)Malone said the Biden administration’s approach to transgender medicine issues ""does not make sense,"" adding invasive treatments should not be promoted until they’ve been proven to help more than harm.""We have jumped to hormones and surgery bypassing the most obvious alternative — therapy,"" Malone said. ""We need to take a step back and study these various interventions before we can determine the best way forward. This is just what Sweden, Finland and England have done, and we hope the U.S. will follow suit.""TRANS WOMEN ATHLETES HOLD COMPETITIVE EDGE, EVEN AFTER TESTOSTERONE SUPPRESSION, SCIENTISTS SAYSThe Biden administration has promoted puberty blocker and cross-gender hormone treatment drugs for transgender children even as it spent roughly $17 million on studies to analyze the dangers and uncertainties of the drugs from 2021 to 2022 through the National Institutes of Health. These dangers include the possibility of increased cardiovascular risks, weakened ability to fight sexually transmitted infections and infertility.Moti Gorin, a bioethicist at Colorado State University, said transgender policy has become too politicized in the U.S. and that legislators should join European countries as they backtrack on treatments for transgender youth to better study the impacts.""It is very unusual in medicine to see such substantial international differences among wealthy countries in the approach their medical authorities take to treating patients,"" Gorin told Fox News Digital.

88,Former FBI assistant director sees 'glaring disparity' in DOJ's 'kid gloves' treatment of Biden,"   Fox News’ Lucas Tomlinson reports on news of more classified documents found outside the garage of President Biden’s home in Wilmington, Delaware.A former FBI assistant director is blasting the bureau for its ""glaring disparity"" in how the agency has approached the situations surrounding President Biden and former President Donald Trump s handling of classified materials.The first batch of classified documents in Biden s possession was found at the Penn Biden Center on Nov. 2, just before the 2022 midterm elections, and not revealed until Monday. A search of Biden s garage at his Wilmington home was conducted on Dec. 20 and the remainder of the house, according to Biden s lawyers, was searched this week, when additional documents were discovered.While Trump and Biden s cases have key differences, Chris Swecker, who served for 24 years in the FBI as a special agent and retired from the bureau as assistant director for the criminal investigative division, told Fox News Digital Saturday that the Justice Department is handling things with Biden in a ""genteel"" way.Swecker, referring to the treatment received by Trump during the FBI s raid of Mar-a-Lago last year, said there is a ""glaring disparity in how somewhat identical facts are treated when it comes to the Bidens.""5 MORE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS FOUND AT BIDEN S DELAWARE HOME, WHITE HOUSE LAWYER SAYSAttorney General Merrick Garland looks on as President Biden speaks during an event in the Rose Garden of the White House on May 13, 2022. (Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images)""You know, it s kid-gloves, it s going about it in a very nice way, very genteel,"" Swecker said, noting that the Justice Department is seemingly allowing Biden allies to decide what is looked through and what isn t, as well as what is taken from the properties and what isn t.""This is yet another example, I think, of the genteel way the left and the right are handled,"" Swecker added.Special Counsel to the president Richard Sauber disclosed in a statement Saturday that five additional pages of documents with classified markings were found at Biden s Delaware home Thursday evening, making a total of six classified documents retrieved from the house — in addition to the documents discovered in the garage.Sauber explained that when Biden s personal attorneys identified one classified document at Biden s home on Wednesday, they stopped searching for additional documents because they lacked the security clearances necessary to view those materials — bringing into question the seriousness of the issue and why the DOJ appears to not be assisting with the search of Biden s residences or offices.Under pressure from Republicans, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel Thursday to investigate the classified materials, which Biden claims were ""inadvertently misplaced."" Garland tapped Robert Hur, a former U.S. attorney, to handle the investigation.BIDEN S  IRRESPONSIBLE  HANDLING OF CLASSIFIED DOCS BIGGER  LEAKAGE  RISK THAN TRUMP S, EXPERTS SAYPresident Joe Biden is shown in the Oval Office at the White House on January 13, 2023. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Biden s cooperation with the DOJ as authorities investigate the classified documents has been praised by Democrats. Sauber stressed in his statement that Biden ""takes classified information and materials seriously"" and said the president s lawyers ""will continue to cooperate"" with the special counsel s investigation.""We are confident that a thorough review will show that these documents were inadvertently misplaced, and the President and his lawyers acted promptly upon discovery of this mistake,"" Sauber said.""Based on what we know now, Biden is unlikely ever to face charges, whereas Trump is at high risk because of his obstructive conduct and other factors absent from the Biden case,"" Norm Eisen, an ethics lawyer and counsel for House Democrats, wrote in a opinion column for CNN. ""The cases have special counsels and classified documents in common — but little else.""Trump, Eisen argued, resisted turning over the materials after months of discussions and a subpoena and insisted he had a right to keep them, while Biden said he was unaware that classified documents — at least the first set — were in his possession, and his lawyers voluntarily turned them over to the DOJ.WHO HAD ACCESS TO BIDEN CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS? REPUBLICAN DEMANDS WHITE HOUSE RELEASE DELAWARE VISITOR LOGSAt the time of the FBI s raid of Mar-a-Lago, prior to public knowledge that he also had classified materials stashed away from his time as vice president, President Biden questioned how Trump could be so ""irresponsible.""Asked why the FBI is leaving the search of Biden s Delaware residence for additional classified materials to White House aides, Swecker said there should have already ""been an open investigation"" and that it reminds him of how the FBI treated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was able to avoid charges for her use of a private email server during her tenure.""This is a continuation of that kid-gloves, soft touch that they have with things to the left of the political aisle,"" he said. ""On the right side, they come in with swat teams and search warrants and come hard. It shouldn t be that way.""""I think it s bad for the FBI to go using search warrants to do that sorta thing,"" he added. ""They should subpoena and they should do this in a way that is short of conducting an outright raid. But that s not what they did with Trump – they just raided his Mar-a-Lago residence.… If it s good for Trump, it should have been good for Biden, as well. There is a disparity of how this very identical set of circumstances were handled.""At the time of the FBI s raid of Mar-a-Lago, prior to public knowledge that he also had classified materials stashed away from his time as vice president, President Biden questioned how Trump could be so ""irresponsible."" (Getty Images, photo illustration)Swecker also said he believes the documents found at Mar-a-Lago were in a much safer spot than those found in Biden s Delaware home, which served as his residence for the time between his role as vice president and president.""I think they were safer at Mar-a-Lago, I mean it took an FBI swat team to get in there,"" he said. ""You can t get in the gate. I m sure there was a log there because he was still under Secret Service protection. [They] were locked inside a closet, the hotel has got cameras and security, so it s buttoned down pretty doggone tight. They had made sure it was locked at the request of the archives and DOJ.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""Now a garage door, you can go out to any one of these tech places and you can program any garage door opener to open up any garage door, practically,"" Swecker added. ""[Biden] wasn t under Secret Service protection at the time, from my understanding, and the house was empty a lot of that time. That house was inherently insecure. It s much less secure than Mar-a-Lago.""Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House.Kyle Morris covers politics for Fox News.

94,"State Freedom Caucus Network expanding reach across US, as more states set up groups","   Fox News correspondent Aishah Hasnie has the latest on the House speakership war on  Special Report. The State Freedom Caucus Network, which launched at the end of 2021 with the support of the influential House Freedom Caucus, expanded its reach throughout the U.S. on Wednesday after what organizers say was a groundbreaking 2022.The network, run by veteran Republican strategist Andy Roth and former House Freedom Caucus Executive Director Justin Ouimette, officially launched additional state caucuses in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho on Wednesday – taking the number of states it has caucuses in to 10.The network helps establish caucuses at the state level, while offering financial support and other resources as they seek to keep their parties in line with conservative principles, in the same way that the House caucus has sought to keep leadership’s feet to the fire in Washington, often provoking the ire of powerful Republican lawmakers who see such efforts as extreme.In an interview with Fox News Digital, Ouimette and Roth said that they intend to launch a total of between 10-15 additional states in 2023 so that they will be in half of the states by the end of the year.HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS MOVES TO EXPAND REACH TO STATE LEVEL, EMPOWER CONSERVATIVESRep. Scott Perry speaks to reporters following a meeting with House Republicans at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 3, 2023. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)""2023 is going to be an amazing year for conservatives,"" Roth said. We re witnessing what s happening at federal level and that fight I think still needs to occur. And thankfully, we had the House Freedom Caucus in Congress to do that. But all of the big fights in our countries are happening at the state level.""He mentioned school choice, election integrity and critical race theory as some of the top issues facing conservatives at the state level, although he noted that issues change depending on the individual state.""These are big, big fights. And before the network was created, conservatives simply didn t have the organization and the strategy to fight effectively.""The network has three prongs: an educational arm to train lawmakers on policy and procedure; the network itself to recruit conservatives at the state level; and an ""action"" arm to help protect conservatives from retaliation in primaries and to expand numbers.HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS TO NOMINATE BYRON DONALDS FOR HOUSE SPEAKERAcross the now more than a dozen states, organizers pointed to a number of successes. In Georgia, a mental health bill underwent changes after the freedom caucus and others raised concerns that it would fund transgender surgeries and made it easier for guns to be removed from Georgians due to mental health concerns.Meanwhile, in Mississippi, the state’s caucus helped kill an economic development bill that would have created an inter-state agency that opponents feared would be able to unaccountably levy taxes and seize property through eminent domain. But organizers say that the long-term effect may be broader than specific campaigns against individual pieces of legislation, and may instead be in patterns of voting behavior from lawmakers.""A big difference that we expect to see are changes in voting behavior where conservatives may have taken a walk or gotten shouted down before,"" Ouimette said. ""They have a built-in legislative coalition to vote with and the organization and infrastructure to communicate their ideas out and change the voting behavior of their colleagues. And I think we ll see that in the dozen states that were in.""The network has the full support of the House Freedom Caucus itself, which is regularly a thorn in the side of Republican leadership in Washington. At time of writing on Wednesday, the caucus had successfully helped GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy from taking the speaker’s gavel. Former Speaker John Boehner had referred to the caucus as ""anarchists"" who want ""total chaos.""Current Freedom Caucus Chair Scott Perry said, in a statement to Fox Digital, that the state network in one year ""has empowered state-level conservatives to fight against local issues that directly affect their daily lives.""""This Nationwide network is critical in providing conservatives the resources to challenge the status quo, hold the establishment accountable, and serve as the conservative conscience in state Houses across the Country,"" he said. ""I look forward to continuing our efforts at the state and federal level to promote liberty, safety, and prosperity for the American People.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPNow, with 10 networks set up, organizers have one eye towards the 2024 election cycle, particularly the primaries -- where they intend to promote and support more conservative candidates to fill out their numbers at the state level.""We’ll be ready,"" Ouimette said.Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital, primarily covering immigration and border security.He can be reached at adam.shaw2@fox.com or on Twitter.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.SubscribedYou ve successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

100,Biden's visit to Kentucky bridge highlights infrastructure push,"   Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what s clicking on Foxnews.com.President Joe Biden s visit to a notoriously dilapidated bridge connecting Ohio and Kentucky is a chance for him to showcase accomplishments and talk up the virtues of bipartisanship while rubbing shoulders with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell.The trip on Wednesday is also about cold, hard cash.""It’s a giant bridge, man,"" Biden said this week when asked about his planned trip to the Brent Spence Bridge. ""It’s a lot of money. It’s important.""WEST VIRGINIA RECEIVES GRANTS TOTALING $9.2 MILLION TO REMOVE ABANDONED, DILAPIDATED STRUCTURESIndeed, the nearly $1 trillion that Biden s administration is doling out for roads and bridges, broadband networks and water projects across America will be critical not just for the communities getting the help but to the Democratic president’s political theory that voters are hungry for bipartisanship that delivers tangible results.As the prospects for massive, transformational legislating diminish rapidly this year in a divided Washington, the White House and top Cabinet officials aim to focus instead on selling Biden’s recent achievements and demonstrating how the new laws directly affect Americans.That new effort kicks off as Biden stops in northern Kentucky at the perennially congested bridge spanning the Ohio River that has frustrated motorists for decades. The infrastructure law enacted in late 2021 will offer more than $1.63 billion in federal grants to Ohio and Kentucky to build a companion bridge that will help unclog traffic on the Brent Spence.Other top administration officials are holding similar events Wednesday and Thursday at other major bridges in the U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is stopping by the collection of bridges crossing the Calumet River in Chicago; Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was appearing at the Gold Star Memorial Bridge in New London, Connecticut; and White House infrastructure coordinator Mitch Landrieu was to be at the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.All the bridges will get new funding under the infrastructure law, which is one of Biden’s marquee bipartisan accomplishments.President Joe Biden s Wednesday visit to Kentucky s Brent Spence Bridge was used to highlight his administration s infrastructure agenda. The Brent Spence, which connects Cincinnati and northern Kentucky, was declared functionally obsolete by the Federal Highway Administration in the 1990s. It has become an outsized symbol of the nation s crumbling infrastructure, with successive presidents from both parties singling out the aging span as they stumped for better roads and bridges.In 2011, President Barack Obama name-checked McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner, who represented the Cincinnati suburbs, as he stood near the Brent Spence and pushed the two Republican leaders to support a jobs package that would fix similarly ailing bridges. Six years later, President Donald Trump told a local Fox station that ""I’ve already heard about the bridge. I love the area.""""We’re going to get it fixed,"" Trump said about the Brent Spence, which he called ""dangerous.""As for Biden, he said during a 2021 CNN town hall in Cincinnati that his administration would ""fix that damn bridge of yours."" The span was designed for 80,000 vehicles a day but was easily doubling that on its narrow lanes.On Wednesday, Biden can begin to make good on that promise.BILLIONS FUNNELED TO GREEN AGENDA ONE YEAR AFTER BIDEN SIGNED INFRASTRUCTURE LAWThe president will be accompanied at Brent Spence by McConnell, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, former Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican. Officials hope much of the work on the new project will be completed by 2029.The White House also invited Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and newly sworn in J.D. Vance of Ohio, according to a White House official, but neither planned to appear with Biden in northern Kentucky.McConnell, who was already home in Kentucky, will not fly with Biden on Air Force One but will greet him on the tarmac at Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport, according to a person who was not authorized to speak about the minority leader s travel plans publicly and insisted on anonymity.Biden dismissed any notion that the trip to northern Kentucky was about highlighting his longstanding relationship with McConnell, who has been both an ally and a foil during the president’s first two years in office. McConnell was one of 19 Senate Republicans to support the infrastructure law and has said repairing the Brent Spence has long been a priority.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""This is a bridge that has been a major national issue for 25 years, my top transportation project for decades. And it’s going to be fully funded by the infrastructure bill, which I supported,"" McConnell told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday.

A public inauguration for the governor and others taking statewide offices is scheduled for Thursday.Hobbs was surrounded by her parents, husband and two children as she placed her hand on a family Bible and took the oath of office in the lobby of the governor s office, according to a livestream of the event, which was not open to the public or media.

Phoenix has some of the nation s highest inflation levels and housing costs have soared as rapid population growth has outpaced home construction, belying the state s reputation for affordability. And the water supply is constrained by drought.Hobbs narrowly defeated Republican Kari Lake, a former television anchor who was backed by former President Donald Trump. She excited conservatives with her staunch backing of Trump, including his lies about the 2020 election, and her strong criticism of mask mandates and business closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But she struggled to connect with Arizona s general electorate, which has repeatedly eschewed Republicans closely aligned with Trump going back to the 2018 midterms.DEMOCRAT KRIS MAYES WINS ARIZONA ATTORNEY GENERAL RACE BY JUST 280 VOTES, RECOUNT CONFIRMSHobbs is the fifth woman to be Arizona governor.

While Hobbs took office on schedule, the public ceremony was delayed because Monday is the observed New Year holiday.Also formally taking office Monday were Democrats Adrian Fontes as secretary of state and Kris Mayes as attorney general, both of whom defeated Trump-backed Republicans who refused to concede and unsuccessfully challenged their losses in court.

It has infiltrated numerous corners of American society, including our national celebrations — as seen at the New Years Eve celebration in New York,"" Sobolik said.

114,"Indiana’s Rep. Jim Banks is 'strongly considering' run for Senate in 2024, says he would 'get in quickly'","   Republican Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, in an interview with Fox News Digital in Washington D.C. on Dec. 14, 2022, discusses the possibility of launching a 2024 run for the Senate.EXCLUSIVE: Republican Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana says he’s ""strongly considering"" a 2024 run to succeed GOP Sen. Mike Braun, who announced on Monday that he’s bidding for governor of the Hoosier State rather than seek re-election in the Senate.In an exclusive interview with Fox News this week, Banks said that if he pulls the trigger on running for his state’s open Senate seat, he’ll ""get in quickly"" and showcase that he’s been ""a strong, reliable, conservative in the House.""Banks, a former state senator and a veteran of the Afghanistan war who represents a district in northeast Indiana, is outgoing chair of the Republican Study Committee, an influential group of conservative House lawmakers. But last month Banks was narrowly edged out by Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the chair the past two cycles of the National Republican Congressional Committee, in the race for House majority whip, which is the number three leadership position in the incoming Republican majority in the chamber.Braun on Monday announced his gubernatorial bid, jumping into what’s expected to be a crowded field of GOP contenders vying to succeed Republican Gov.

""As you know, one of Indiana’s U.S. Senate seats will become open in 2024, and I have been asked to consider it,"" she said in a statement last week.Banks highlighted his conservative credentials, saying, ""I’m proud of my consistent, conservative voting record in the House.

115,"House Republicans, eyeing probes, tell NGOs working with migrants at southern border to preserve docs","   National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd weighs in as officials brace for post-Title 42 surge on  Your World. FIRST ON FOX: A group of House Republicans, led by Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, are calling on three NGOs that work with migrantsat the U.S. southern border to preserve documents and communications related to their operations – as they eye investigations into the movement of illegal immigrants into the U.S. interior.Gooden along with Reps. Tom Tiffany, R-Wis., Jake Ellzey, R-Texas, and Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., wrote to Catholic Charities USA, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services and Jewish Family Service of San Diego, expressing concern about ""the growing role [NGOs] play in fueling the drastic increase in illegal aliens crossing the southern border.""The Biden administration is circumventing the security and safety standards federal agencies must uphold by allowing NGOs to harbor, transport, and encourage unauthorized aliens to resettle in the United States,"" they write.They accuse the NGOs of ""violating federal law and regulation, placing migrants and American communities at risk, and subjecting local communities to unreasonable burdens.""BIDEN ADMIN SUES ARIZONA OVER CREATION OF SHIPPING CONTAINER BORDER WALL TO STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRATIONMigrants are released by Border Patrol in Brownsville, Texas this week. While the role of NGOs in aiding migrants who have crossed the southern border predates the Biden administration, their role has come under greater scrutiny amid a historic surge at the southern border, which saw more than 2.3 million migrant encounters in FY 2022 alone.FY 2023 is so far on track to exceed that number, and there are fears of an even greater surge once Title 42 ends in the coming days, with many of them being released – often into the care of NGOs who provide the migrants with supplies and often help with travel to their destinations.DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said this week that the end of Title 42, which DHS predicts could lead to up to 14,000 migrant crossings a day, will require even greater cooperation with NGOs.12.14.22 - Letter to Catholic Charities on Document PreservationbyFox Newson Scribd""We re mindful of the fact that Title 42 is going to end early next week,"" Mayorkas told The El Paso Times. ""We re also mindful of the fact that we have to coordinate with our partners, not just the nonprofit organizations with which we work very closely, not just cities along the border like El Paso, but also our international partners. So we re moving as quickly as we can.""But the Republicans object to what they believe is the use of taxpayer funds that go to NGOs to fund the movement of illegal immigrants into the U.S. interior.""Taxpayers should not be subsidizing any organization facilitating the movement of illegal immigrants across our border,"" they say in the letters. ""When NGOs transport unauthorized aliens into the nation’s interior, it becomes increasingly difficult for federal immigration enforcement agencies to monitor their whereabouts and protect our communities.""The GOP will take the House in January and its leadership has said it intends to investigate many aspects of the Biden administration’s handling of the crisis at the border. The lawmakers on Wednesday said they want the use of NGOs to be investigated as well.FOX NEWS FOOTAGE SHOWS MASS RELEASE OF MIGRANTS INTO US, AS NUMBERS HIT 500,000 FOR FY 23""Next Congress, we will continue to investigate your organization’s role in facilitating the border crisis, your potential violations of federal law, and your misuse of taxpayer funds,"" they say.Specifically, they request the preservation of documents related to expenditures for reimbursement from the federal government.""It’s past time for investigations into the corrupt network of NGOs who are aiding and abetting illegal migration and human smuggling,"" Gooden said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""House Republicans plan to hit the ground running next Congress and these organizations need to know their tax-exempt status and ability to operate have been put on notice.""In a statement posted to its website, Catholic Charities USA said it was ""incredibly disturbing"" for the charity – the domestic humanitarian arm of the U.S. Catholic Church – to be accused of violating federal law and fueling the increase of migration across the border.""These accusations are both fallacious and factually inaccurate. Our life-saving humanitarian work neither violates federal laws nor endangers communities,"" the organization said. ""The federal government is fully responsible for maintaining the U.S. border and determines who enters the country.""The organization said that its humanitarian assistance – including food, clothing and overnight shelter – is provided legally and begins only after a migrant has been released by the federal government. Without that help, the charity said, migrants would be on the streets.BORDER OFFICIALS SEEING MASSIVE MIGRANT NUMBERS, LARGE GROUPS AHEAD OF TITLE 42 S END""Let us be clear. The U.S. immigration system is in dire need of reform; Catholic Charities and all those agencies and individuals responding to this national crisis are operating within a broken system,"" it said. ""We urge all Americans to ask the administration and their congressional representatives to act on this important issue, as we have done.""The letters come a day after Gooden spoke at a Heritage Foundation event, in which the think tank unveiled new data it says showed that NGOs had helped facilitate the transport of illegal immigrants to 431 congressional districts out of a total of 435.Mike Howell, director of the Heritage Foundation’s Oversight Project, described the operation as a ""mass resettlement program in which the Biden administration works hand-in-hand with NGOs.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""It affects the entirety of the United States,"" he said.Meanwhile, Texas Gov.

Check out what s clicking on Foxnews.com.With the beginning of winter roughly a week away, major cities across the U.S. are looking to mask up once again for the purpose of combating not just COVID-19, but the flu and the respiratory illness RSV.Philadelphia has imposed a temporary mask mandate for students and school staff when they come back from winter break in January. For two weeks, they will be required to wear face coverings, Superintendent Tony Watlington announced Wednesday.""Many of us will be involved in quite a few social gatherings over the next few weeks,"" Watlington explained at a news conference, as reported by local WHYY. Watlington called the move a ""proactive measure"" to prevent the spread of illnesses.The decision mirrors how the school year began, with two weeks of masking that began in August.NEW YORK CITY ‘STRONGLY’ URGES MASKS AMID ‘HIGH LEVELS’ OF COVID, FLU, RSVOf the three illnesses. Only RSV -- respiratory syncytial virus – lacks any kind of vaccine. RSV is a fairly common ailmentthat normally results in cold symptoms, but it can be particularly dangerous for very young children and the elderly. Cases of RSV have spiked recently. According to an article published by NYU Langone, this could be the result of people dropping COVID-19 practices of masking and social distancing, as well as children who did not catch it during the COVID pandemic now being exposed to it.In Boston, some parents want schools to bring back school mask mandates when students return after winter break.The organization BPS Families for COVID Safety wants 10 days of masking and increased COVID-19 testing. They presented a petition to school headquarters Wednesday with almost 200 signatures, according to NBC Boston. Boston Public Schools has not made any decision yet.COVID-RELATED HOSPITALIZATIONS INCREASING AMONG US SENIORS""Student safety is paramount at Boston Public Schools. We continue to meet daily with the Boston Public Health Commission to review the latest BPS data and make informed decisions regarding our COVID-19 protocols,"" they said in a statement.In California, Los Angeles County officials have stopped short of requiring masks for everyone, but they are recommending that everyone from the age of 2 and older wear masks indoors again. County Department of Health Director Dr.Barbara Ferrer said last week that millions of county residents are at elevated risk from the flu, RSV, and COVID-19 and advised masking up for several weeks.""When you put on your mask for these few weeks during this surge, it s about the people of L.A. County,"" Ferrer said.While the county is not requiring masks, a future mandate has not been ruled out, but it also is not being viewed as an inevitability.CHINA BACKS DOWN ON TESTING, QUARANTINE REQUIREMENTS AMID LOCKDOWN OUTRAGE""We re actually not sure that we ll get there,"" Ferrer said.The county does require masks for people who have COVID-19, as well as for those who have been in close contact with people who have it and those who work or live in places that had a recent outbreak. Mask mandates are also in effect in healthcare settings and congregate care facilities.In Chicago, Department of Public Health commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said she personally wears masks in public indoor settings, even though there is no mandate in place.""I would advise putting a mask on, you know, while we re in high respiratory season. If you re in these crowded sites, you know, if you re on the L, and if it s busy, you know, in a store, etc.,"" she said, according to NBC Chicago. She noted that if hospitalization numbers climb, ""we may make some more broad recommendations for [the] general population kind for indoor mask wearing, not requirements right at this point, but some more recommendations.""Chicago is located in Cook County, which the CDC lists as a ""medium"" community level of COVID infections. Of the state’s 102 counties, 12 are listed as ""high"" level, which means the CDC recommends that everyone wear masks, whether they are vaccinated or not.New York City officials are also strongly recommending masks this winter. The city’s Department of Health issued an advisory last week urging residents to wear a mask in certain situations amid ""high levels of COVID-19, flu and RSV.""AMERICAN COLLEGES MANDATE UPDATED COVID-19 BOOSTER SHOT, STUDENT SAYS IT S ‘OUT OF LINE’In a Friday press release, the New York City Department of Heath said that ""high-quality masks"" should be worn when ""indoors and in crowded outdoor settings.""The advisory states that ""everyone should wear a mask"" when ""in an indoor public setting, including inside stores, offices, lobbies, hallways, elevators, public transportation, schools, child care facilities, and other public shared spaces.Nearby locations are taking varied approaches to masks.

118,DC court paves the way for political dark money to get even darker,"   Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what s clicking on Foxnews.com.A new ruling on the Federal Election Commission (FEC) could pave the way for more untraceable donations in politics this week, closing off a key avenue for watchdogs to peer into FEC rulings.The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday refused to reconsider its 2021 decision to block courts from reviewing FEC rulings and prevent private watchdog groups from issuing challenges to certain decisions, the Washington Post reported Thursday. The court s opinion argues that judges have no authority to challenge the FEC s invocation of ""prosecutorial discretion"" when defending its decisions not to pursue a given case.Prosecutorial discretion refers to the authority of prosecutors to determine the extent of enforcement of a given law.Since the courts cannot rule on such decisions, private groups seeking to scrutinize spending cases have no avenue to bring challenges against decisions the FEC defends under prosecutorial discretion. Activists argue this opens a clear road for defending all sorts of dark money donations, according to WaPo.SOROS TAKEOVER: OUTRAGE AS MIAMI’S ANTI-COMMUNISM RADIO MAMBI COULD BE CONTROLLED BY OBAMA, CLINTON STAFFERSSunset at the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, Dec. 9, 2021.

Raphael Warnock (D-GA) on the east front of the U.S. Capitol Building on Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2022 in Washington, DC. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) This is due in part to the makeup of the FEC, which, like many other federal organizations, is led by a bipartisan commission. But while organizations like the FCC are led by a five-person commission with a maximum of three commissioners per party, the FEC is led by six commissioners with a maximum of three per party. The organization also requires at least four votes to move forward with prosecuting a case, leading to frequent deadlocks.ARABELLA ADVISORS: FIRM OVERLOOKING MOST POWERFUL LEFT-WING DARK MONEY NETWORK IN AMERICA EXPANDS OPERATIONSPrior to 2021, private organizations could challenge cases that they argued the FEC wrongfully dismissed. Now, however, those challenges would fail so long as the commissioners who rejected the case defended their decision under prosecutorial discretion, FEC Commissioner Ellen Weintraub, a Democrat, told WaPo.Dark money spending accounts for tens of millions in political donations for both Republicans and Democrats every election cycle, allowing groups to pour funds toward certain candidates with little-to-no public scrutiny.U.S. President Joe Biden departs from Holy Spirit Catholic Church after attending Mass on St. Johns Island, South Carolina, U.S., August 13, 2022.

House Democrats on Thursday will call up legislation aimed at ending Puerto Rico’s status as a U.S. territory and giving Puerto Rican voters a say in whether the island becomes a U.S. state, an independent country or some other form of non-territory status.Democrats prepared the Puerto Rico Status Act in the House Rules Committee on Wednesday night, allowing for debate and a vote on the bill on the House floor Thursday with just days left before they give up control of the House to Republicans. The bill is the result of negotiations that took place this year among lawmakers of Puerto Rican descent and others, but the sudden push to take such swift action related to a U.S. territory shocked Republicans.""I do have to say, with only a few legislative days left in this Congress, no path forward in the Senate, I’m not sure why this matter warrants an emergency meeting of the Rules Committee when so many outstanding issues remain,"" Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, said Wednesday night.Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., is hoping to quickly move a bill giving Puerto Rico the option of independence.

They also said the bill only went through the House Natural Resources Committee and that several other committees should have a say on something as important as a revised political status.HURRICANE FIONA: PUERTO RICO FACES ANOTHER DAY WITHOUT POWER, FLASH FLOODING AND  CATASTROPHIC  DAMAGEA man stands in front of a beach before the arrival of Hurricane Fiona in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

123,Sam Brinton helped craft model school policy keeping parents in dark about kids' gender change,"   Jesse Watters highlights how Biden’s non-binary nuclear energy specialist allegedly was charged with felony theft on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’Sam Brinton, the non-binary former federal government official who is now facing the possibility of significant prison time, played a key role in developing a model school policy adopted in multiple states that instructs school districts to keep ""unaffirming"" parents in the dark about a potentially suicidal child’s gender identity or sexual orientation.Brinton, a biological male who gained notoriety for being one of the U.S. government’s first non-binary officials, was recently fired from the Office of Nuclear Energy,an agency of the Department of Energy (DOE), after being charged with stealing airport luggage on multiple occasions.Before joining the federal government, Brinton was in charge of advocacy and government affairs at the LGBTQ youth suicide prevention nonprofit The Trevor Project, where he helped craft a ""Model School District Policy on Suicide Prevention"" in 2019 along with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the American School Counselor Association and the National Association of School Psychologists.Brinton cheered the model at the time, saying it’s ""imperative"" forschool suicide prevention policies to be ""LGBTQ competent.""Sam Brinton attends The Trevor Project s TrevorLIVE LA 2019 at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on November 17, 2019, in Beverly Hills, California.

""Conversely, acceptance and support by family results in higher levels of self-esteem, lower levels of suicidal ideation and self-harm incidents, and better overall physical health.""Sam Brinton speaks onstage during the Trevor Project s TrevorLIVE LA 2018 at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on December 3, 2018, in Beverly Hills, California.

If the principal, designee, or mental health professional believes, in their professional capacity, that contacting the parent or guardian would endanger the health or well-being of the student, they may delay such contact as appropriate.""""Consultation with another mental health professional is recommended before taking such inaction,"" the model adds. ""If contact is delayed, the reasons for the delay should be documented.

""Additionally, when referring students to out-of-school resources, it is important to connectLGBTQ students withLGBTQ-affirming local health and mental health service providers.""The model has been adopted, at least in part, by the state education departments for Arizona, Idaho and Virginia, as well as local school districts in California, New Hampshire and Oregon, to name a few.""Parents love their children and want the best for them; we desperately want to be involved in their lives so that we can help our family members thrive, both personally and academically,"" Nicki Neily, founder and president of Parents Defending Education, told Fox News Digital.

126,Southern border sector sees massive spike in illegal migrant encounters as Title 42’s end approaches,"   Former Border Patrol chief Rodney Scott joins  Fox News Live  to discuss the GOP calling for DHS Secretary Mayorkas  resignation for his management of the border crisis, the lifting of Title 42, and the morale of border officials.At least one section of the southern border is seeing a massive spike in migrants crossing illegally into the U.S., with just weeks to go before the Biden administration will lose its ability to expel them under a frequently used Trump-era authority.Fox News has learned from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) sources that in the El Paso Sector alone there were 1,926 migrant encounters in the span of 24 hours. That brings the total for the fiscal year, which began in October, to 105,263 for the sector.That’s up 257% compared to this time last year, which itself was the highest number on record.Across the border there have been more than 400,000 migrant encounters by Border Patrol since Oct. 1, Fox has learned, and numbers are on track to surpass half a million before the middle of December, earlier than that number was reached in FY 2022 – which saw a record 2.3 million encounters overall.BIDEN ADMINISTRATION S BORDER WOES INCREASING, AS 2022 DRAWS TO A CLOSEMigrants attempting to cross into the U.S. from Mexico are detained by Customs and Border Protection, Aug. 20, 2022, in San Luis, Arizona. (Nick Ut/Getty Images)Official CBP numbers showed more than 230,000 migrant encounters in October, up dramatically from the more than 164,000 encountered in October 2021.One Border Patrol agent told Fox that it had been a ""rough"" first quarter for agents.""No support. No backup. No leadership,"" they said.The increase in numbers comes as the end to the Title 42 public health order – which was implemented in March 2020 and has been used to rapidly expel a majority of migrants at the southern border – looms over the Biden administration’s border maneuvers.A federal judge ruled earlier this month that the U.S. government’s use of the authority is unlawful and ordered a halt to Title 42 expulsions – before granting a five-week extension. It means the order will expire on Dec. 21.While the Biden administration had attempted to end the order earlier this year (but was also blocked by a federal judge), it had recently expanded its use to include Venezuelan nationals.REPUBLICANS, AHEAD OF HOUSE TAKEOVER, LOOK TO ZERO IN ON BIDEN ADMIN S HANDLING OF BORDER CRISISThe administration says it has a six-point plan in place that includes a surge in resources, greater tackling of smuggling organizations, more technology and a greater use of authorities like expedited removal and criminal prosecution for illegal border crossings.But the end of the order has still led to concern from both Republicans and Democrats that it will lead to an additional surge in migrants trying to enter the U.S.Moderate Democratic Sens.

127,Gov-elect and Secretary of State Katie Hobbs sues Arizona county for not certifying election results,"   Arizona s Governor-Elect Katie Hobbs said the Biden administration wasn t ""doing enough"" to address the border crisis.Katie Hobbs, Arizona s secretary of state and governor-elect, sued Cochise County officials Monday over not certifying the results of her gubernatorial election, two weeks after she was projected to win the race.Cochise County officials reportedly voted against certifying the results of the gubernatorial election by the state s statutory deadline, prompting Hobbs to file the lawsuit.The 53-page lawsuit urged Cochise County officials to confirm the results of the election, claiming that by law, the canvass would proceed with or without counting the county s votes if they did not meet the deadline.""The Cochise County Board of Supervisor… has, without justification, failed to fulfill its mandatory duty to meet and approve its canvass of the results of the 2022 General Election by the statutory deadline of November 28, 2022,"" the lawsuit claimed.ARIZONA GOV ELECTION: KATIE HOBBS DEFEATS GOP CHALLENGER KARI LAKE, RACE MAY NOW GO TO RECOUNT UNDER STATE LAWAccording to Hobbs  lawsuit, the board of supervisors voted 2-1 to not move forward with certification until ""after the Board hears from a group of individuals opposing certification.""The board also requested more information from election officials about the accuracy and reliability of voting machines used in the county, according to the lawsuit, which Hobbs  office said is not a valid reason to delay certification.

129,"Biden admin's Commerce appointee was longtime business partner of Hunter Biden, emails reveal","   Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley joins  Hannity  to discuss whether he believes there is political bias in the Department of Justice and the latest in the Hunter Biden investigation.FIRST ON FOX: A business executive who was tapped earlier this year to serve another term on President Biden s Advisory Council on Doing Business in Africa (PAC-DBIA) previously worked as a senior adviser to Hunter Biden’s now-defunct investment firm and strategized with the younger Biden on brokering business deals in Western Africa years prior to his appointment in the current administration, Fox News Digital has learned.On July 14, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo reappointed John Nevergole, co-founder and CEO of the Philadelphia-based project development firm ABD Group, and 23 others to serve a two-year term on the PAC-DBIA from 2022 to 2024.Nevergole and ABD Group Executive Chairman Mohamed Keita, the son-in-law of former Malian President Amadou Toumani Toure, co-founded the company over 15 years ago and they currently promote their company as a ""trusted partner to investors, multi-national firms and African governments"" with ""over $2.5 billion USD of investment across the continent.""""Today ABD Group has a presence on the ground to develop projects in every major market in West, Central, East, and Southern Africa. Partners include Fortune 500 companies and the world’s largest emerging market investors,"" their website reads. An archived version of the ABD website highlights that they were ""happy to have worked with"" China’s state-owned China Development Bank and China Airport Construction Corporation (CACC), among other corporations. CNN Philippines reported in 2020 that the state-owned CACC was one of the subsidiaries of the China Communications Construction Company that was ""blacklisted"" by the Trump administration.John Nevergole, co-founder and CEO of the Philadelphia-based project development firm ABD Group. (YouTube screenshot/U.S. Department of Commerce)An archived version of the website also shows that Hunter Biden was listed as a member of ABD’s board of advisers for several years until his bio was removed sometime between Jan. 23 and May 29 in 2019, according to the Wayback Machine. While Nevergole was serving as the CEO of ABD, he was simultaneously serving as a senior adviser to Rosemont Seneca Advisors as early as 2012. However, it appears that his association with Rosemont Seneca in his ABD bio was erased from the website sometime shortly after March 2019.Nevergole’s relationship with Hunter Biden dates back to at least 2011, according to emails reviewed and verified by Fox News Digital. In an Aug. 5, 2011, email chain, Eric Schwerin, then-president of Hunter s Rosemont Seneca Advisors, informed Hunter that Nevergole had requested to split a retainer fee 70/30 for helping broker a deal between Rosemont and Brazilian construction giant OAS.In August 2011, Hunter Biden s longtime business partner, Eric Schwerin, emailed Hunter about a conversation he had with John Nevergole regarding a request to split a retainer fee 70/30 for helping broker a deal between Rosemont and Brazilian construction giant OAS. (Fox News Digital)After Hunter pushed back on the price, Schwerin, who was also a member of ABD’s board of advisers for several years, argued, ""So, I am OK with 70/30 … Mainly because I think the relationship can bear fruit in other areas down the line, e.g. in Africa if we choose to focus there.""Longtime Hunter Biden business partner Eric Schwerin told Hunter in 2011 he was okay with the 70/30 split because ""the relationship can bear fruit in other areas down the line"" in places like Africa.

(Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images)A few years later, Schwerin sent an email to Hunter on May 29, 2014, saying he ""talked to John Nevergole yesterday and he said you had mentioned to him you wanted to discuss natural gas at some point.""At the time, Hunter had just been appointed to serve as a board member for the Ukrainian oil and gas company Burisma Holdings, which he has received intense scrutiny over for several years, prompting him to later admit he used ""poor judgment"" and that he would not join the board again if he could do things over.Eric Schwerin told Hunter Biden in a 2014 email that their business partner, John Nevergole, mentioned that Hunter ""wanted to discuss natural gas at some point."" (Fox News Digital)""Not sure if it was Burisma related but he wanted me to tell you that he and Mohammed are really expanding their staff in Ivory Coast and Mozambique, two countries with energy resources,"" Schwerin wrote in the email, referring to Nevergole s business partner Mohamed Keita.Later that same day, Nevergole sent an email to Hunter and Schwerin listing ""potential gas opportunities for discussion,"" including in Equatorial Guinea, Cote d Ivoire, Mozambique, Ghana and Angola. ""‎Please let me know the thoughts on the above and if Burisma would be interested to explore any further,"" Nevergole added.A couple days before Christmas 2014, Nevergole emailed Hunter and said he was ""looking forward to 2015 being a successful year for Rosemont and ABD and for us expanding our work together"" and added, ""Let s make it a profitable year.""John Nevergole emailed Hunter Biden in December 2014 to wish him a ""Merry Christmas and Happy New Year"" and said he was ""looking forward"" to a ""successful year for Rosemont and ABD."" Nevergole added, ""Let s make it a profitable year."" (Fox News Digital)In April 2015, Nevergole emailed Hunter and Schwerin about a trip he was taking the following month to Beijing to ""meet with funds and investors to further talks about putting together investment for Africa and also Latin America"" and asked if they had any contacts they would recommend, prompting Schwerin to respond, ""We will connect you with our guys over in China."" Less than a week later, Schwerin introduced Nevergole to BHR Managing Director Xin Wang, saying that ""I am partners with Hunter Biden and I know Jim Bulger reached out to you about meeting with a colleague and good friend of ours, John Nevergole.""In April 2015, John Nevergole asked Hunter Biden and Eric Schwerin whether they had any suggestions for people to reach out to in China for his upcoming visit to Beijing. (Fox News Digital)Eric Schwerin told John Nevergole that they would ""connect"" him ""with our guys over in China."" (Fox News Digital)""I believe John will be in Beijing on May 4th and available to meet, but I have copied him on this email so you and John can coordinate directly,"" Schwerin continued. ""Thanks in advance to you and the BHR team for agreeing to see John and his colleague next week.""In April 2015, Eric Schwerin introduced John Nevergole to BHR Managing Director Xin Wang, saying that ""I am partners with Hunter Biden and I know Jim Bulger reached out to you about meeting with a colleague and good friend of ours, John Nevergole."" (Fox News Digital)BHR formed in 2013 when the Boston-based Thornton Group LLC, a firm that joined forces with Hunter’s now-defunct Rosemont Seneca Partners, launched its joint-venture with Chinese investment firm Bohai Capital.Wang thanked Schwerin for the introduction and said it was a ""pleasure to meet the both of you over email and I look forward to our in person meeting in the coming week.""Xin Wang thanked Eric Schwerin for the introduction to John Nevergole and said it was a ""pleasure to meet the both of you over email and I look forward to our in person meeting in the coming week."" (Fox News Digital)A day after the May 4th meeting, Nevergole emailed Wang to thank her for meeting with him, saying, ""It sounds like BHR is doing great things and that there could also be synergies to explore. I will send you more information on opportunities that could potentially be a fit when I have it for your review. Look forward to meeting again sometime soon, either in Beijing or in US.""Nevergole would then email Hunter and Schwerin on May 6 informing them it ""was good to meet BHR"" and that he would like to ""catch up"" when he returned to the U.S. so he can give ""feedback of the trip overall, what we are thinking, and go over some ideas on how we can work together overall on the China initiative.""In May 2015, John Nevergole told Hunter Biden and Eric Schwerin that it was ""good to meet BHR"" and that he wanted to catch up with them to ""go over some ideas on how we can work together overall on the China initiative."" (Fox News Digital)This exchange wasn’t the only time China came up in discussions with Nevergole. Two months earlier, Nevergole offered Schwerin advice to pass along to Hunter before a planned trip to China.""In terms of Hunter s trip to China I would say one immediate thing is if there are any large firms, typically the state owned construction companies, that they know who we should try to meet when we go to China,"" Nevergole said in a February 2015 email. ""These groups generally bring funding from China Exim to fund the African government on a project to be done by the China state owned construction firm.""In February 2015, John Nevergole offered Eric Schwerin advice to pass along to Hunter Biden before a planned trip to China. (Fox News Digital)""For example this is what we are doing with CACC (China Airport Construction Corppration) and what we do with Samsung with Kexim money,"" Nevergole added. ""They work with us to put the deal together in Africa.""Nevergole would send an email to Hunter, Schwerin and Keita in November of that same year, laying out the terms for ABD’s ""ongoing relationship"" with Rosemont, as well as future steps to meet with the presidents of Cameroon and Senegal, which he said would help with ""advancing the deals.""In a November 2015 email to Hunter Biden and Eric Schwerin, John Nevergole presented terms for ABD’s ""ongoing relationship"" with Rosemont, as well as future steps to meet with the presidents of Cameroon and Senegal, which he said would help with ""advancing the deals."" (Fox News Digital)Emails also show that Nevergole served a key role in facilitating meetings with foreign diplomats and world leaders. For example, Hunter was scheduled to meet with the ambassadors of Senegal and Cameroon in D.C. on Nov. 23, 2015, according to emails between Nevergole, Schwerin and Hunter’s scheduler, but it is unclear what was discussed at the meetings. Nevergole did not respond to Fox News Digital’s inquiry about the meetings.However, an email from Nevergole to Schwerin about two weeks earlier sheds some light on what the discussions likely entailed, including introducing the deals they were working on in Senegal and having ""the Ambassador of Senegal give the feedback to the President.""""Ambassador can then coordinate a first meeting between the President, Mohamed and I,"" Nevergole said. ""Then at a later date all of us can schedule a subsequent meeting with the President.""Nevergole laid out a similar outline for the meeting with the Ambassador of Cameroon.A couple months after Biden left office in January 2017, Schwerin sent an email to Hunter saying Rosemont held equity in ""30% of ABD’s interest in six energy, infrastructure and healthcare projects in Western Africa."" It is unclear whether Hunter still has an equity stake in these projects or whether there were other ABD projects that he was invested in.In March 2017, Eric Schwerin sent Hunter Biden some of his ownership interests and project descriptions, which included ""30% of ABD’s interest in six energy, infrastructure and healthcare projects in Western Africa."" (Fox News Digital)In November 2021, after President Biden took office, ABD announced that Nevergole had signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Senegal’s state-run Ageroute to ""develop, finance, and construct two bridges to ensure trade between Senegal and its neighbors remains easily accessible.""HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP WHISTLEBLOWER SAYS HE S STILL AFRAID TO LEAVE DELAWARE HOMEThe Nov. 22, 2021, signing took place in Senegal and featured remarks from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.""I believe that the ripple effects will be felt throughout Senegal.

(ANDREW HARNIK/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)""This project will ensure the vitality of a key trade corridor between Senegal and its neighboring countries while supporting hundreds of jobs in both Senegal and the U.S.,"" he said.The State Department referred Fox News Digital to the White House about whether they were aware of Nevergole’s business connections to Hunter Biden and whether the younger Biden played a role in Nevergole being reappointed to the council during the Biden administration. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A spokesperson for the Department of Commerce initially told Fox News Digital that ""Mr. Nevergole was appointed to this board by Secretary Wilbur Ross and the Trump administration in 2019"" in a Tuesday evening email. When Fox News Digital pointed out that this term was from 2019 to 2021, the spokesperson expanded on the statement Wednesday to explain how Commerce Secretary Raimondo reappointed him earlier this year.""Secretary Ross and the Trump Administration first vetted and appointed Mr. Nevergole for the PAC-DBIA in 2019,"" the spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""Mr. Nevergole applied for reappointment, and he was reappointed in the ordinary course of business. His prior association with Hunter Biden played no role in that re-appointment.""Nevergole attended a similar MOU signing in Senegal during the Trump administration in early 2020 after the summer 2019 appointment by then-Commerce Secretary Ross for the same position.Notably, the majority of the advisory council’s members under Trump lost their spots under Biden. Of the 26 members appointed by Ross, only eight, including Nevergole, were reappointed by Raimondo. A Commerce spokesperson pointed Fox News Digital to multiple resources outlining the process for applying for the council, including the application Nevergole would have had to fill out. The presidential advisory board is not considered part of the federal government and the appointees are unpaid.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPNevergole did not respond to multiple Fox News Digital inquiries asking whether the Biden administration was aware of his business history with Hunter prior to him being reappointed, why he erased Rosemont from his bio, or for details about the meetings between Hunter and the ambassadors.Hunter’s lawyer and Schwerin did not respond to Fox News Digital’s inquiries asking whether Hunter still has a financial stake in any of the ""six"" ABD projects in Western Africa.

""The idea is to provide mentors that the employees relate to as they navigate the early phases of their careers or transition to new roles or responsibilities. The goal is to improve recruitment and retention of excellent pretrial and probation staff.""Mentors for the program will work to build a ""psychologically safe space for mentees,"" the memo said.

135,Buttigieg insists congressional intervention to prevent rail strike is 'best way forward',"   Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg talks with Fox News Digital about the threat of a nationwide rail strike and how Congress should intervene.MEMPHIS, Tenn. – Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is urging Congress to come together in a bipartisan fashion to pass legislation to prevent a looming rail strike that would cripple the American economy, calling it the ""best way forward"" amid stalled labor negotiations between the major freight railroads and four hold-out unions.Buttigieg s comments came during a Tuesday evening interview with Fox News Digital at the Memphis International Airport, where he touted a $174 million investment from the Department of Transportation (DOT) for the production of de-icing pads at the facility""Where I hope to see it going is bipartisan cooperation to move this quickly through Congress and get it to the president s desk,"" Buttigieg said. ""Look, I don t care what your politics are, America can t have a rail shutdown. There is no substitute for a well-functioning rail system in the country.""Buttigieg insisted a prior agreement reached in September by rail companies and union negotiators — which, according to the Association of American Railroads, would provide rail workers a 24% wage increase during the five-year period from 2020 through 2024, including an immediate payout on average of $11,000 upon ratification — should be implemented through congressional action.PELOSI, SCHUMER AGREE TO MOVE RAILROAD UNION BILL ‘ASAP’ AFTER WHITE HOUSE MEETINGTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg speaks during a news conference at the Memphis International Airport in Tennessee, on Tuesday, Nov. 29, 2022. (Lucy Garrett/Bloomberg via Getty Images)""Now, this tentative agreement that was reached at the bargaining table back in September, no side got everything they wanted, but the companies and the union leaders agreed on this framework. Now, the president is asking Congress to enact that framework and prevent the possibility of a shutdown.""When asked about potential backlash from congressional intervention, Buttigieg said, ""we have encouraged the parties to resolve this at the table when things were beginning to get to an impasse. Pursuant to his authority, the president initiated that process that created the presidential emergency board. All of that set things in motion to get to that tentative agreement. Now we re at a point where it is going to require an act of Congress to see that through and enact the deal.""""It is the best way forward for us as a country, for our economy, and it means taking those hard fought negotiated outcomes that the parties, companies and Labor sat at the table and worked out, carrying those through and most importantly, avoiding a shutdown that would be devastating for workers and families across the country,"" he added.However, the intervention is already being met with opposition from both sides of the political aisle, setting the stage for a potential gridlock in Congress that could carry on past the Dec. 9 strike deadline. Rail workers and unions are calling for additional sick days to be included into the contract.""If the rail industry can afford to spend $25.5 billion this year to buy back its own stock and hand out huge dividends to its wealthy shareholders, please do not tell me it cannot afford to guarantee paid sick days to its workers and provide them with a decent quality of life,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said Tuesday.Activists in support of unionized rail workers protest outside the U.S. Capitol on Nov. 29, 2022, in Washington, D.C. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has criticized President Biden for seeking to impose a union contract that had been rejected by rank-and-file railroad workers.""Just because Congress has the authority to impose a heavy-handed solution does not mean we should,"" said Rubio. ""It is wrong for the Biden Administration, which has failed to fight for workers, to ask Congress to impose a deal the workers themselves have rejected.""WITH RAIL STRIKE LOOMING, BIDEN SAYS HE HAS  NOT DIRECTLY ENGAGED,  CONTRADICTING WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARYThe Association of American Railroads, which represents giant carriers including BNSF, CSX, Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific, estimates a rail shutdown would cost the U.S. economy $2 billion a day – and every American would feel it.Biden warned Tuesday that if rail work stoppage occurs, up to 765,000 Americans ""could be put out of work in the first two weeks alone.""Following Biden s call for congressional intervention, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday they would work to pass legislation and implement a labor agreement for railroad workers.The U.S. rail system moves cargo equal to 467,000 long-haul trucks each day, transporting hazardous chemicals, fertilizers, apparel, household and perishable goods. With the trucking industry already short-handed and a shortage of around 80,000 drivers, it would be impossible for other shipping options to fill the void if rail freight halts.Freight cars sit in a rail yard on Nov. 22, 2022, in Wilmington, California. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)Touting the DOT s investment in the creation of a 3.3-million-square-foot de-icing facility at Memphis International Airport, which is home to FedEx’s largest air cargo sorting facility, Buttigieg said. ""This is a major investment that includes over $173 million in federal support, because these de-icing facilities make it possible for our supply chains to work the way that they need to.""""We re talking about massive air operations. This is actually the busiest air cargo hub in North America. And we need to make sure that we re doing everything we can to move goods efficiently and affordably. There s been a lot of attention on passenger air travel. Cargo, air transportation is just as important to our economy. We want to shine a light on the equipment, but most importantly on the people who get that done, especially going into the holiday season.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPButtigieg — who ran for president in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries — was also asked about 2024 and whether he would make a similar commitment to that of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who dismissed speculation last week that he would challenge Biden in 2024 should he decide to seek re-election to the White House.""I can t talk about campaigns and elections while I m in this capacity, but the president s made clear his intentions,"" Buttigieg said. ""I m proud to be part of this team and very proud to support everything the president is doing. We ve got a lot to show for it and our work is just beginning.""Fox News  Haris Alic and Breck Dumas contributed to this article.Kyle Morris covers politics for Fox News.

Waltz said the second driver came from his goal to replicate the winning strategy House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, of New York, used with women GOP candidates and implementing that with GOP veteran candidates.""Elise Stefanik has enjoyed a lot of success in recruiting and supporting Republican women to run.

Jeanne Shaheen and Ted Cruz got into a back-and-forth after Shaheen shut down Cruz s questions on President Biden s role in the 2016 firing of a top Ukrainian prosecutor. New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz got into a heated exchange Tuesday after Shaheen shut down Cruz s questions for an ambassador nominee concerning allegations that then Vice President Joe Biden pressured Ukrainian officials to fire the country s top prosecutor in 2016.Cruz accused the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairwoman of ""covering"" for Biden after Shaheen prevented nominee George Kent from answering his questions during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Kent, who is Biden s choice to be the next ambassador to Estonia, had previously testified as a witness during former President Trump s first impeachment inquiry and told lawmakers that he raised concerns about Hunter Biden s lucrative service on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company – only to be rebuffed by the Biden administration.The gas company, Burisma Holdings, was under investigation in 2016 by Ukraine s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who himself faced allegations of corruption. In 2018, Biden admitted that while he was vice president, he pushed Ukrainian officials to fire Shokin by threatening to cancel $1 billion of loan guarantees.Cruz asked Kent, ""Do you think Joe Biden holding a billion dollars hostage to force the Ukrainian government to fire the prosecutor that is investigating the corrupt oligarch who s paying his son a million dollars a year?

According to the complaint filed in federal court on Tuesday, the failure resulted in ""a catastrophic loss of pressure in the distribution system"" that meant ""many residents had no running water and thus lost the ability to use water for basic safety and hygiene purposes[.]""As a result of this, the complaint says residents had to use bottled water and ""other alternative water sources"" from government agencies and elsewhere. Service resumed on Sept. 6, but the effects remain ongoing, the DOJ said.""Even beyond this event and continuing through the present,"" the complaint says, ""contaminants are in or are likely to enter the City’s public water system that may present an imminent and substantial endangerment within the meaning of the SDWA. The City has also violated various specific requirements of the SDWA and administrative orders issued by EPA concerning the City’s public water system.""The lawsuit explained how contaminants would get into a water system that does not have sufficient water pressure.JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI, RESIDENTS FILE LAWSUIT OVER WATER CRISISClouds are reflected on the City of Jackson s O.B.

Solis, Pool)""When inadequate or low water pressure is present in the System, negative pressure may pull water from outside a distribution line to inside the distribution line through cracks, breaks, or joints in the distribution lines that are common in all drinking water systems,"" the complaint says. ""This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as ""back siphonage."" Back siphonage can introduce contaminants into treated, potable water inside the lines downstream of the water treatment plant, before the water is delivered to users.""Water donation sites give residents bottled water for consumption. (Joy Addison/Fox News)While the pump failure occurred in August 2022, Jackson has had problems with its water system since at least February 2020, when the EPA began its inspection and issued an Emergency Administrative Order that said the water system’s conditions ""presented an imminent and substantial endangerment"" to residents that included the possibility of contaminants including E. Coli. Since then, federal, state, and city officials have been taking steps to address the situation, which has since been affected by weather conditions and an electrical fire at one of the plants in April 2021.JACKSON MAYOR SAYS FEDERAL FUNDING ‘INSUFFICIENT’ TO ADDRESS CITY S WATER INFRASTRUCTUREFirefighters and recruits for the Jackson, Mississippi, Fire Department carry cases of bottled water to residents vehicles, Aug. 18, 2022, as part of the city s response to longstanding water system problems. (AP Photo/Rogelio V.

141,Biden admin pledges additional $53M to bolster Ukraine’s power grid,"   Fox News correspondent Jeff Paul gives the latest update on how civilians in Ukraine are coping with winter amid war on ‘Special Report.’President Biden s administration has pledged an additional $53 million in aid to Ukraine to assist in fixing the war-torn country s electrical grid.The $53 million will be used largely to purchase circuit breakers and distribution transformers, according to The New York Times. The funds come as part of a multinational effort to bolster Ukraine s energy infrastructure, which has been targeted with Russian missile strikes for more than a month.Russian President Vladimir Putin s forces shifted toward targeting Ukraine s power and water stations in early October, seeking to make Ukrainian citizens suffer through the country s bitter winter.In total, the U.S. has sent nearly $20 billion in military aid to Ukraine since Russia s invasion began in February.PROGRESSIVE LAWMAKERS URGE BIDEN TO  ENGAGE IN DIRECT TALKS WITH RUSSIA  TO END INVASION OF UKRAINEUkrainian soldiers fire an artillery at Russian positions near Bakhmut, Donetsk region, Ukraine, Sunday, Nov. 20, 2022.

A potential audit would determine how much, if any, of the U.S. aid is ending up in the wrong hands.

Some staunch Ukraine allies fear the party will cut off aid to the country entirely, however.The lawmakers agree that current monitoring efforts appear woefully inadequate, with the Biden administration inspecting just 10% of the 22,000 weapons the U.S. has provided to Ukraine between February and Nov. 1, according to the Washington Post.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California speaks at an election event, Nov. 9, 2022, in Washington.

142,Supreme Court skeptical of Biden administration's immigrant deportation policy,"   Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, reacts to the Supreme Court hearing Texas  challenge to the president s immigration and deportation policies on  America Reports. A majority of the Supreme Court appeared likely to limit the federal government s discretion when enforcing guidelines dealing with illegal migrant deportations, an important case over the Biden administration s immigration strategy.In more than two hours of intense oral arguments on Tuesday, all six conservative justices had tough questions about the 2021 Department of Homeland Security policy that prioritizes certain groups of unauthorized immigrants for arrest and deportation – only those considered a serious threat to public safety, border security, terrorism or espionage.A ruling could put more pressure on the federal government to adopt a tougher removal policy for a broader range of illegal immigrants, including those that may not have committed a crime and have been in the U-S for years.Chief Justice John Roberts noted federal immigration law mandates DHS ""shall"" detain and remove most non-citizens in the country illegally.ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION SET RECORDS THIS YEAR, BUT DEMOCRATS KEPT BORDER FUNDING FLAT""It s our job to say what the law is, not whether or not it can be possibly implemented or whether there are difficulties there,"" said Roberts. ""And I don t think we should change that responsibility just because Congress and the executive can t agree on something that s possible to address this problem. I don t think we should let them off the hook. So shouldn t we just say what we think the law is, even if we think  shall  means  shall,  and then leave it for them to sort that out?""However, the Biden Justice Department argued the federal government is dealing with the reality of limited resources due to congressional funding inaction, and that it retains discretion on enforcing the policies.President Biden answers a reporter s question at the White House, Sept. 20, 2022. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)""Immigration policy is supposed to be the zenith of federal power and especially executive power,"" said Justice Elena Kagan. ""And instead we re creating a system where a combination of states and courts can bring immigration policy to a dead halt... you re coming in here with a set of speculative possibilities about your costs"" of illegal immigration.Following a lawsuit by Louisiana and Texas, a federal judge issued a nationwide injunction vacating or freezing the ""Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law"" policy. The Biden administration then asked the high court to intervene.WATCH LIVE: THE SUPREME COURT HEARS ORAL ARGUMENTS ON IMMIGRATION CASE | FOX NEWS VIDEOThe GOP-led states say the situation along the Mexican border is a growing crisis, and that they are suffering financial, security, education and healthcare problems associated with the new policy.However, the Justice Department criticized a single federal judge s injunction, saying it amounted to a ""nationwide, judicially imposed overhaul"" of the executive branch s enforcement priorities, noting federal authorities are best equipped to handle the detention of illegal immigrants, with its limited resources.The Biden policy sharply modified the Trump DHS guidelines that aggressively moved to deport illegal immigrants, regardless of their criminal history or community ties. Previous administrations had also used their discretion to implement immigration policies.A number of both red- and blue-leaning states have challenged various immigration policies in recent years involving both GOP and Democrat administrations.A Venezuelan migrant, waves before boarding a bus outside of St. Andrew s Parish House at Martha s Vineyard, Massachusetts, Sept. 16. (Carlin Stiehl for The Boston Globe via Getty Images)In the last Supreme Court term, the justices debated separate appeals over asylum seekers, and public benefits available to newly-arrived migrants. Courts have traditionally limited the ability of states to challenge federal immigration enforcement policies – or implement their own. However, the current high court conservative majority seems more eager to consider states challenges.The high court in this case was dealing with three issues: whether the state plaintiffs have ""standing"" in court to challenge the DHS enforcement policies, whether those guidelines are contrary to federal law, or otherwise violate the Administrative Procedure Act; and whether federal law prevents the entry of an order to ""hold unlawful and set aside"" the Guidelines under federal law.TEXAS DPS INTERCEPTS HUMAN SMUGGLING ATTEMPT, DISCOVER 18 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN TRUCK TRACTORThe 6-3 conservative majority seemed poised to give the states the right to sue and sharply questioned the federal government s discretionary enforcement arguments.Justice Samuel Alito said the federal government was showing ""special hostility"" toward the states over their ability to bring these kinds of immigration enforcement challenges in the first place.The strongest comments from the right, however, came in reaction to the administration s assertion federal judges lack authority in this case to block the Biden guidelines nationwide.Roberts said courts have had the power for decades – ""over and over and over again"" – to issue ""vacaturs"" or orders temporarily voiding a government agency s action."" He called the government s position ""fairly radical,"" adding ""wow!"" in apparent astonishment.A man was arrested near Brett Kavanaugh s home in Maryland for allegedly threatening violence toward the justice. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)Justice Brett Kavanaugh added the arguments were ""astonishing,"" ""extreme"" and ""extraordinary.""Later in the argument, both justices questioned the Texas solicitor general, saying the federal government was not able to enforce the law, for practical reasons.""The government says: we don t have the money to comply. Then what do you do?"" asked Kavanaugh. ""So nothing changes... if they say: we have don’t the money to comply with the court s order?""The court has a number of options, including throwing out the entire lawsuit or ruling the lower courts had no authority to vacate the policies nationwide. Or the court could proceed to the merits and say federal law requires a no-tolerance approach to deportingillegal immigrants.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe case is U.S. v. Texas.

Larry Hogan of Maryland speaks with Fox News Digital about a potential 2024 presidential run and lessons the GOP can learn from the results of the 2022 midterm elections.Term-limited Republican Gov. Larry Hogan is marking eight years of steering the blue state of Maryland and looking towards a future that may include a 2024 GOP presidential run as he gathers with family, friends, supporters and donors from across the country on Wednesday.Hogan is taking part in a leadership summit in Annapolis, Maryland’s capital city, that’s attracting high-profile GOP leaders such as former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, and retired neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson — a 2016 presidential candidate who served as Housing and Urban Development secretary in former President Donald Trump’s administration.The summit will be followed by two celebratory events in nearby Baltimore that are hosted by An America United, the Hogan-aligned public advocacy group, and the Better Path Forward PAC, a recently launched federal political action committee.From the launch of the PAC to numerous visits this year to Iowa and New Hampshire – the states that kick off the Republican presidential nominating calendar — as he crisscrossed the country supporting fellow Republicans running in the 2022 elections — Hogan’s made many of the moves a politician makes in advance of launching a White House campaign.WHEN WILL TRUMP HOLD FIRST 2024 RALLY; PENCE HEADING BACK TO NEW HAMPSHIREMaryland Gov.

I think it may affect a lot of other people’s decisions,"" Hogan emphasized. ""For me, I’m definitely going to be a voice. I care very deeply about getting my party back on track. I care about the country being off on the wrong track and being controlled by Democrats. And I’m going to see what’s the best role for me.""Hogan, who’s long been a vocal GOP critic of Trump, stressed during his Republican Jewish Coalition speech that the former president ""said we would be winning so much we’d get tired of winning. Well, I’m sick and tired of our party losing. This is the third election in a row that we lost and should have won.""""I say three strikes and you’re out,"" Hogan argued.The Baltimore event for Better Path Forward, which roughly 300 people are invited to attend, will serve as the first major fundraiser for the new PAC. And the celebration organized by An America United is expected to draw roughly 1,000 people.""For eight years, Governor Hogan has demonstrated how to lead and deliver common sense conservative results in a deep-blue state, and we’ve seen overwhelming support in Maryland and across the country for building on this model of success. We are excited to host these events to celebrate that success and look toward the future,"" An America United executive director David Weinman told Fox News.2022 AUTOPSY: WHAT REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS SAY ABOUT FUTURE OF GOPHogan in recent weeks has been a leading voice among a chorus of Republicans – in the wake of a lackluster performance by the GOP in the midterm elections – whoare emphasizing that a forward-looking approach and greater attention to the issues matter most to voters.The former president has taken plenty of incoming fire from fellow Republicans angry that many of the Trump-endorsed far right GOP nominees, many of whom heavily supported the former president’s unproven claims that the 2020 election was ""rigged"" and ""stolen,"" lost in key races that arguably cost the party control of the Senate, a larger House majority, and crucial governorships.Former President Donald Trump during an announcement at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, US, on Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2022.

""Your actions are a blatant disregard for congressional oversight and a violation of statutory law.""Hawley’s letter comes after an explosive report in The Intercept which revealed that, while DHS dissolved the controversial ""Disinformation Governance Board"" earlier this year, the agency is still working with Big Tech to combat ""disinformation"" on a range of topics, including COVID-19, vaccines, racial issues, the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and Ukraine aid.Among the revelations was a leaked document showing Facebook’s secured Government Reporting System, which allows government officials to directly flag content on Facebook or Instagram and request that it be taken down.BIDEN S WAR ON ‘DISINFORMATION’ RAMPS UP AS GOP ACCUSES OFFICIALS OF PLAYING POLITICS WITH THE TRUTHSept. 13, 2022: U.S. Sen.

A lot of these will be directed at Scott, especially if the reports are true that he was preparing to challenge McConnell before Election Day had even concluded.""Both McConnell and McCarthy have support from the vast majority of their members. McConnell has a larger cushion because Senate GOP party elections only require a simple majority of the conference – unlike House speaker elections.McCarthy, meanwhile, could face opposition from somewhere between 15 and 20 of the caucus  members if he refuses to work with them on their demands for reform, a source familiar with the dynamics in the Freedom Caucus said.

But Republicans are not home free and still must win most of the races in which they’re leading in order to take control of the House.2022 MIDTERM ELECTION RESULTSHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., needs six more victories for a GOP majority in the chamber. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)As of Sunday afternoon, Republicans were leading in nine remaining races across the country and will need to win six of those to get to 218, or possibly win other races where they are not currently leading.Many of the GOP leads in these nine races are very close and are getting closer over the last few days as the slow counting of mail-in ballots continues.Six of those nine races are in California, where those slim GOP leads appear to be more at risk of slipping away. In California’s 13th District, for example, Republican John Duarte is leading by fewer than 100 votes, and barely half the votes had been counted as of Sunday.WHO WON THE HOUSE?

California has also said it might still be weeks before those races are decided.The three other narrow GOP leads are in Colorado, Arizona and New York. In Colorado, Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert was holding a lead of just a bit more than 1,000 votes over her Democratic challenger with nearly 99% of the vote in.In Arizona, Republican Juan Ciscomani was up fewer than 2,000 votes with nearly 87% of the vote in.ELECTION DAY 2022 IS OVER; READY OR NOT, HERE COMES 2024 WHITE HOUSE RACEHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi would be sent to the minority if Republicans can win a few more House seats.

Kathy Hochul s narrowing lead over Republican challenger Lee Zeldin as a good sign that may galvanize more Democrats to show up on Election Day.Hochul was beating Zeldin by 17 points in August polls, but her lead has now shrunk to single digits, with some pollsters placing her just 4 points ahead. The close race is unnerving for Democrats in a deep blue state where registered party members outnumber Republicans roughly two to one. Democrats argue the polling will serve as a ""wake-up call"" for their base, according to Politico.""When Democrats turn out, we win,"" Hochul told CNN on Friday. ""I think what’s not being captured in the polls is that there really is, finally, energy on the ground.

152,Supreme Court to hear case of Texas couple fighting to keep adopted Native American child,"   Chad and Jennifer Brackeen are litigants in a Supreme Court case set for oral argument next month over the Indian Child Welfare Act, which their lawyers say is racially discriminatory against non-Native families seeking to adopt Native children.The Supreme Court this week will hear the case of a Texas family at risk of losing one of their two adopted Native American children because of a federal law they allege gives tribes ""race-based"" priority in custody disputes.The case, Haaland v. Brackeen, combines litigation from a handful of other families and multiple interested states, including Texas, where Chad and Jennifer Brackeen live with their children. The tribes defending the law, meanwhile, warn that if the Brackeens win, the case could have far-reaching consequences that undermine their sovereignty.At the center of the controversy is the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), a 1970s law meant to protect Native American children in state custody proceedings.""There are Americans out there who are eager to help these children out, and the Indian Child Welfare Act says they are not allowed to because their skin is the wrong color,"" Timothy Sandefur, an adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, told Fox News Digital.Chad and Jennifer Brackeen told Fox News Digital that they are worried their adopted daughter, Y.R.J., could be ""ripped"" from their family thanks to the Indian Child Welfare Act. (Tyler Olson/Fox News Digital)TEXAS FAMILY FIGHTS AT SUPREME COURT TO KEEP ADOPTED NATIVE AMERICAN CHILD DUE TO LAW THAT FAVORS TRIBES""That s outrageous and unconstitutional,"" he said. Sandefur wrote a brief for the Goldwater institute supporting striking down ICWA.ICWA was a reaction to high rates of Native children being adopted by non-tribal members – often with little process and unjustly.It prioritizes placing Native children with extended family members, members of their tribe, and if that s not possible, with another Native family. Exceptions for ""good cause"" are allowed but not defined.Tribes argue that their children are key to their continuation as political entities and that their unique status under U.S. law means legislation directed at the tribes isn t race-based.ABORTION RIGHTS PROTESTERS INTERRUPT SCOTUS ARGUMENT SESSION""The precedent of the Supreme Court is that Indian tribes are political groups of people, they are not racial groups of people,"" Chrissi Ross Nimmo, the deputy attorney general of Cherokee Nation, told reporters last month. ""Tribes determine citizenship ... just like countries.""The Supreme Court will hear the case Haaland v. Brackeen on Nov. 9, 2022. Several Native American tribes and a handful of states are also parties in the case. (Collection of the Supreme Court of the United States via Getty Images) (Collection of the Supreme Court of the United States via Getty Images)But critics of the law say it removes the best interest of a child, including staying with adults they ve known for some time, in favor of placing a child with anyone of the same or a similar race.""No other federal law that is triggered by a child s biological eligibility for tribal membership,"" Sandefur said. ""Every other Indian law on the books applies to a person because that person is a member of a tribe.""""Congress’s racial discrimination is ‘most evident’ in ICWA’s third placement preference … which bluntly favors any ‘Indian famil[y]’ from any of 574 tribes over any non-Indian family,"" a brief from the Brackeens  lawyers says.SUPREME COURT LIKELY TO BAN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS, LEGAL EXPERTS SAYChad and Jennifer Brackeen s journey to the Supreme Court began when Navajo Nation sought to place their adopted son, referred to in court documents as A.L.M., with unrelated tribal members who lived in a different state.The family to whom the Navajo Nation wished to send A.L.M. stepped back from the proceedings, and the Brackeens won custody. But their adoption saga continued after A.L.M. s mother gave birth to his half-sister, known as Y.R.J.The Supreme Court Tuesday will hear a case that could have major ramifications for Native American sovereignty. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File) (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)The biological mother supported placement with the Brackeens. But Navajo Nation sought to place Y.R.J., according to the Brackeens  lawyers, ""in another state hundreds of miles away with either a great-aunt or an unrelated Navajo couple.""That case is still in a state court in Texas. But the Brackeens  lawyers say the result of their Supreme Court case, which stemmed from their fight to keep A.L.M., will likely decide the result of Y.R.J. s case and thus the future of their family.AFFIRMATIVE ACTION CASE: JUSTICES ALITO, ROBERTS SNAP AT HARVARD LAWYER""Our children are young, our oldest is 13, the baby sister is 4 and a half. So, to some degree, only the oldest are fully aware of what we re going through,"" Chad Brackeen told Fox News Digital. ""And it s our responsibility to sort of shield our children at this point of the uncertainty, that she could ultimately be taken, ripped from our home and moved states away.""Another major issue Sandefur said the case could turn on is whether ICWA unconstitutionally commandeers state courts to implement federal policy.""ICWA is the only federal law in existence that is exclusively enforced by state officials. The feds don t enforce ICWA,"" Sandefur said. ""But our federalist system under our constitution prohibits Congress from compelling states to enforce laws against their will.""Justice Neil Gorsuch is known to be ""sensitive"" to Native American legal issues. (Erin Schaff/The New York Times via AP, Pool, File)Lawyers backing top tribal leaders, however, say the consequences for Native Americans could go far beyond adoption disputes if the justices rule against them.JUSTICES HEAR ARGUMENTS OVER AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN HARVARD, UNC SUPREME COURT CASESKate Fort, the director for the Indian Law Clinic at Michigan State University, called the case a ""facial attack on tribal sovereignty."" She also said it could ""lead to a fundamental re-understanding of how Congress can or cannot pass laws for tribes.""Fort said other litigants suing over an alleged gambling monopoly for Native Americans in Washington state are already mimicking the arguments used in the Brackeen case.Oral arguments are scheduled for Wednesday, with an extended hearing set to last nearly two hours due to the number of parties.Unlike many politicized cases, the court may not split directly along ideological lines. Tribal law is a subject on which the justices at times may form unusual alliances to decide a case.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP""A lot of people are particularly interested in how Justice Gorsuch is going to look at this case, because he has a reputation for being very sensitive to… Indian law issues,"" Sandefur said.Tyler Olson is a for Capitol Hill Producer for Fox News in Washington, D.C.Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.SubscribedYou ve successfully subscribed to this newsletter!

A source in Trump s political orbit waved Fox News off the actual date of Nov. 14 but added ""that week is being looked at, but it’s all fluid.""Kochel, a veteran of numerous presidential campaigns, said that if the latest reporting on the former president comes to fruition, ""Trump is going to push his chips on the table within a week or two after the midterms and then we’re off to the races.""IT S ALL ABOUT LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION, AS TRUMP RETURNS TO IOWATrump has been constantly flirting with making another presidential run since leaving the White House in January 2021. At rallies across the nation in support of his endorsed GOP candidates in recent months, Trump has discussed the potential for a 2024 run and has repeatedly said, ""I may have to do it again.""The former president has also repeatedly made unproven claims that his 2020 election loss to now-President Biden was due to ""massive voter fraud.""Former President Donald Trump reacts to a supporter during a rally, Thursday, Nov. 3, 2022, in Sioux City, Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)The former president amped up his 2024 language during a rally Thursday in Iowa, the state whose caucuses for half a century have kicked off the presidential nominating calendar. ""I will very, very, very probably do it again, OK? Very, very, very probably,"" Trump said at the rally in Sioux City, located in the deep red northwestern corner of Iowa. ""Get ready. That’s all I’m telling you. Very soon. Get ready. Get ready.""Nearly two years after his re-election defeat, Trump remains hands-down the most popular and influential politician in the Republican Party, and the most ferocious fundraiser who holds sway over grassroots donors. And poll after poll indicates that Trump would start out as the overwhelming front-runner for the GOP nomination.WARNING SHOT FROM TRUMP TO POTENTIAL GOP 2024 RIVALSHowever, Trump s standing in the GOP and repeated 2024 teasing hasn t kept other potential Republican White House hopefuls from making moves toward launching presidential campaigns.Former Vice President Mike Pence; former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo; former South Carolina governor and former ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley; Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ted Cruz of Texas; and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan are among the possible White House hopefuls who have made multiple trips to Iowa and the other early-voting primary and caucus states over the past year and a half.Former Vice President Mike Pence headlines the annual Kaufmann Family Harvest Dinner, on Sept. 29, 2022 in Wilton, Iowa. (AP)Besides a potential Trump announcement, the week after the midterms will also see the first real Republican 2024 cattle calls.Up first is the Republican Governors Association’s annual winter meeting, which is being held this year near Orlando, Florida. Among those attending who have said they’re mulling a White House bid or who are viewed by political prognosticators as potential contenders are Govs. Ron DeSantis of Florida, Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, Larry Hogan of Maryland, and Kristi Noem of South Dakota, as well as Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, and Pete Ricketts of Nebraska.GET READY FOR THE FIRST MAJOR 204 GOP PRESIDENTIAL CATTLE CALLAt the end of the week, as first reported by Fox News late last month, a dozen GOP politicians whom pundits view as potential or likely contenders for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, will attend the Republican Jewish Coalition’s (RJC) annual leadership meeting in Las Vegas.The twelve are Pence, Pompeo, Haley, Cotton, Cruz, Sens.

He’s the big foot in the field.""But he added that the former president ""is not going to clear the field. He’s going to accelerate people’s timelines for deciding whether they go or not go. I think you’ll have some people who say they won’t run because Trump’s in. He’s going to have one or more serious challengers who are going to make a run at him.""And Kochel said ""I would imagine by the end of the first quarter of 2023 we’ll probably know who’s really going to get in.""Rath, also a veteran of numerous Republican presidential campaigns, predicted that ""I think there’s going to be somebody who we’re not looking at now who emerges because there’s an opportunity. They have a window of three to six months to make that decision.""When 2022 collides with 2024 in NHNew Hampshire is a key general election battleground state with crucial Senate race between former governor and first-term Dem. Sen. Maggie Hassan and GOP nominee and former general Don Bolduc that’s one of a handful across the country that will likely determine if the Republicans win back the chamber’s majority. And the state’s two congressional districts are considered competitive — especially the very swingy First District — and the winners in both those races will impact whether the Democrats are able to hold onto their razor-thin majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.But New Hampshire is also the state that for a century’s held the first presidential primary in the White House race, and the Granite State’s seen plenty of traffic this cycle by out-of-state politicians who may harbor national ambitions in the 2024 election cycle. That traffic has intensified in recent days.Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (Fox News)Haley returns to New Hampshire on Sunday to campaign with Bolduc. It’s Haley’s third trip to the Granite State in the past six weeks to team up with her party’s U.S. Senate nominee in New Hampshire.On Wednesday, conservative talk radio host Larry Elder trekked to New Hampshire to team up on the campaign trail with GOP congressional nominee Karoline Leavitt, who’s challenging Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in the First District. Elder, who was the top GOP vote getter in last year’s unsuccessful gubernatorial recall election in California, says he’s mulling a run for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination and promised plenty of return trips to New Hampshire and Iowa, where he also recently stopped.While he wasn’t in New Hampshire in person, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whom pundits view as a possible Republican presidential hopeful, endorsed Bolduc this past week and put his name on a fundraising email for the Senate nominee. Ditto for Sen. Tim Scott, who endorsed Bolduc and whose aligned PAC spent six-figures to boost the GOP Senate nominee. And Sen Rick Scott, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, stopped in New Hampshire last weekend to team up with Bolduc.As for the Democrats, Hassan is getting some high profile help this weekend from three Democrats who ran for the party’s 2020 presidential nomination and may possibly run again in 2024 if President Biden decides against seeking a second term.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the progressive champion, made the short trip on Friday from Massachusetts to New Hampshire to campaign with Hassan at the University of New Hampshire in Durham. And U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota — who came in second and third in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire — join Hassan on the Granite State campaign trail on Sunday.Hogan trolling BidenPresident Biden will be in Maryland on the eve of the election, headlining a Democratic National Committee rally in Columbia, Maryland.Larry Hogan, the term-limited Republican governor of the heavily blue state, plans to bracket Biden’s visit with a video spotlighting the governor’s achievements and criticizing Biden’s presidency.

159,Time is running out,"   Fox News congressional correspondent Chad Pergram discusses the positive and negative effects of time change on  Fox News Live. Time is running out on a Senate plan to make permanent Daylight Saving Time the law of the land.The Senate stunned everyone in March when members approved a bill by unanimous consent to shift the nation forward one hour, year-round.""Without objection, so ordered!"" declared Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., trying to suppress a smile, as she presided over the stupefying vote to end the bi-annual time change.Sinema then sounded like Marv Albert after Bernard King drained a three-pointer at Madison Square Garden.""Yes!!!"" exclaimed Sinema from the Senate dais, pulling her forearms toward her and clenching her fists in a sign of victory.""I think everyone was a little bit surprised that no one came down to object because they were all made aware of it,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who wrote the bill. ""I think there s growing support for the notion of this flipping back and forth makes no sense.""Americans switch the clocks this weekend for the first time since the Senate passed the Daylight Saving Time bill eight months ago. But the House of Representatives isn’t convinced that perpetual Daylight Saving Time is an idea whose time has come. The House hasn’t touched the bill. The Senate bill will expire if the House doesn’t align before the end of this Congress: 11:59:59 a.m. ET on Jan. 3, 2023.For the Senate legislation, you can almost see the grains of sand slipping through the neck of an hourglass – until they all disappear.That said, this is the closest Congress has come to implementing permanent Daylight Saving Time in the U.S. in decades. President Richard Nixon shifted the U.S. ahead an hour for two years during the 1970s OPEC oil embargo. And once one body of Congress approves a piece of legislation, that often ripens the potential for passage in the other chamber.Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida. (Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images)THE SPEAKER’S LOBBY: PROTECTING CONGRESSThat’s why Standard Time may be operating on borrowed time.Congress may not adopt a bill to go to Daylight Saving Time all the time before the end of the 117th Congress. In fact, it may take a few years. But this issue is maturing.""Why do we keep doing this back and forth thing?"" groused Rubio. ""Maybe there s a good reason. But I don t think there is, to be frank.""So why is Congress involved in the setting of time at all?Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress control of time, via a provision to ""fix the standard of weights and measures.""Lawmakers have tweaked time ever since. In fact, Ben Franklin was the first to propose a seasonal switch of the clocks to align better with the sun. Franklin suggested the practice would conserve candles. Believe it or not, Congress has only successfully overridden a presidential veto on 112 occasions in the history of the republic. One of them was over a dispute between Congress and President Woodrow Wilson about changing the clocks after World War I.Lawmakers last wrinkled time in 2004. Congress adopted a massive energy policy bill. Buried in the legislation was a provision that reduced the period the U.S. spent on Standard Time from approximately six months to just four months. That’s why we now ""spring forward"" in March and ""fall back"" in November. The time changes just to unfold in April and October, respectively.Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., crafted the language to change the time.Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI). (Anna Moneymaker-Pool/Getty Images)PAUL PELOSI ATTACK: CAPITOL POLICE BEGIN  INTERNAL SECURITY REVIEW  AFTER OFFICERS MISSED BREAK-IN""Halloween is the number one death day for your kids,"" said Upton.He noted that the time change sometimes fell in October when various communities would hold ""Beggar’s Night,"" a week or two prior to Halloween.""So you had one less hour of sunlight, and you’ve got little kids darting between cars in neighborhoods,"" said Upton. ""We have the extra hour, and it can show that it actually reduces crime because most crime is at night at dusk.""But sleep experts aren’t sold on the time change.Dr. Beth Malow of the Sleep Disorders Division at Vanderbilt University Medical Center says choosing one time or another would be better overall. But Malow dislikes a permanent shift to Daylight Saving Time.""We’re off cycle for an hour for almost eight months out of the year,"" said Malow. ""We’re changing our clocks. But we’re not changing the light.""There are also questions about the economic impact of switching the clocks twice a year. The general thesis is that adjusting the clocks for summer ""gave"" people more daylight.""Ninety-nine percent of your population is awake and moving around and about at that time of the day, and they can use the sun to help them,"" said University of Washington law professor Steve Calandrillo. ""Commerce and most economic and business interests do favor the uniform, permanent Daylight Saving Time because they realize that more people are awake and want to go out and top and recreate and engage in activities in the early evening. That’s when we live our lives.""But it’s debatable whether the time shift is truly lucrative.The U.S. Capitol dome. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc)US CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS WEREN T WATCHING LIVE HOME SECURITY CAMERAS WHEN PAUL PELOSI WAS ATTACKED""The Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 experienced negative returns the Monday following both time switches,"" said Calandrillo. ""You pick any random calendar day over the course of history, it s a positive expected value. And yet the expected value is negative on the Mondays following both clock changes. That will show that people hate when you mess up their sleep cycles. They re in a bad mood and that affects the stock market.""Some have wondered if it may be better to rely on local time standards rather than a sweeping, national mandate from Congress. For instance, St. Paul, Minn., and Minneapolis used to operate on different clocks. The Mississippi River carved a temporal border between the Twin Cities.""Geography probably plays more of a role than politics,"" says Malow. ""This is a nonpartisan issue because it s really about where you live.""That’s why residents in the north or extreme ends of time zones worry about a change that would make it get dark too early – or light too late.""It can be really disruptive to us,"" said Malow. ""They feel off-cycle. Off-kilter. And they just want to be done with it.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThere’s only a finite amount of light and dark to go around, regardless of the season or where you live.If Congress doesn’t change the time change, we’re stuck with the time changing.As they say, time waits for no one.

163,"Rep. Maloney recalls 'eating Chef Boyardee' as kid during inflation talk, says it's 'what families have to do'","   Republican candidate for NY-17 House candidate Mike Lawler blasts his opponent, Rep. Sean Maloney, over inflation comments on  Fox Report Weekend. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., said during a late-October interview that his family would be ""eating Chef Boyardee"" when gas prices went up during his childhood and added ""that s what families have to do"" if they find themselves in financial hardship.""Hudson Valley residents are feeling pain at the pump and at grocery stores, what have you done, and what do you plan to do to help solve our inflation problem?,"" Maloney was asked.""Yeah, well, I grew up in a family where, you know, if the gas price went up, the food budget went down,"" Rep. Maloney said. ""So by this time of the week, we d be eating Chef Boyardee if that budget wasn t gonna change. So that s what families have to do. Here s what we should do,"" Maloney said before discussing actions that he says would lower inflation.""We re capping seniors  out-of-pocket costs in the Medicare program. That s a big deal. So now, only two thousand dollars a year will come out-of-pocket, rain or shine,"" Maloney said. ""That allows seniors to budget. We re also negotiating, finally, in the Medicare program with the big prescription drug companies to lower the cost of everybody s prescription drugs. That s long overdue.""DCCC SPENDS $600K ON ADS DEFENDING LEADER REP. PATRICK MALONEYRep. Sean Patrick Maloney, who heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, feels his party has a ""likability problem."" (Jacquelyn Martin/Pool via Reuters)Maloney made the comments during an interview with Halston Media Productions, published Oct. 27.Maloney also said that ""we ve released 90 million barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve, that s what s taken about $1.30 off the price of a gallon of gas. That s a big help.""""We ve got to do more to keep that price from going back up and keep it coming down. And there s other things we can do. We can absolutely bring health insurance premiums down for those on the Affordable Care Act. We ve done that,"" he added. ""We can pay for these things, by the way, with a tax on big corporations, so they will finally pay what they owe. We finally did that.""When discussing energy, Maloney said ""we can surge the production of energy, particularly renewable energy, so that there s more supply, that brings prices down.""""That s part of the strategy of the Inflation Reduction Act. And all of these strategies together - together with going after price gouging,by the way, because these big oil companies are making a fortune off of Putin s war and the rest. We ve got to make sure people aren t profiting off the war. All of these strategies together can help bring prices down,"" Maloney said.Responding to a request for comment, a spokesperson for Maloney told Fox News Digital that it s ""shameful"" for Mike Lawler, his opponent who shared a clip of the remarks on Twitter, to ""make light"" of the struggles that families are facing.DCCC CHAIR MALONEY DEFENDS BOOSTING TRUMP-BACKED GIBBS, DECLARES ‘WE RE GOING TO WIN THAT RACE’Assemblyman Mike Lawler, Republican candidate for the 17th congressional district, speaks at a news conference at the Westchester County Courthouse in White Plains Oct. 12, 2022. (Reuters)""Unlike Lawler, who is profiting off his own campaign and made bank lobbying for big oil companies, Rep. Maloney understands what families are dealing with. In the interview, Rep. Maloney describes his own childhood, with a limited weekly budget for a family of 8, and explains the steps he’s taken to lower costs, like cutting prescription drug costs, surging energy production, and holding companies accountable for price gouging,"" the spokesperson explained.Lawler told Fox News Digital that Maloney s response shows that he s out of touch with the struggles of working families.""Sean Maloney’s solution to tackling inflation is: let them eat Chef Boyardee!,"" Lawler said. ""It shows just how out of touch he is work [sic] the struggles of seniors, working families, and those in need of assistance. Voters understand the only way to fix it, is to fire the very politicians who have created this mess in the first place, which is why Sean Maloney will lose on Election Day!""Mia Ehrenberg, Maloney s communications director, said on Twitter that Lawler s clip was ""horribly out of context"" and asked why he opposes the Inflation Reduction Act.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOn Oct. 24, the Cook Political Report moved Maloney s race from lean Democrat to toss up.Adam Sabes is a writer for Fox News Digital.
