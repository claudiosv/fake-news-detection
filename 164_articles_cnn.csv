0,,"US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told Congress Wednesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping is likely to press Taiwan and try to undercut US influence in the coming years as he begins a third term as president.While Beijing has stepped up its public criticism of the US, Haines told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the intelligence community assesses that China still believes it “benefits most by preventing a spiraling of tensions and by preserving stability in its relationship with the United States.”The US intelligence community believes that Russia “probably does not want a direct military conflict with US and NATO forces, but there is potential for that to occur,” according to the unclassified annual threat assessment report of the intelligence community issued on Wednesday that US intelligence leaders testified about. “Russian leaders thus far have avoided taking actions that would broaden the Ukraine conflict beyond Ukraine’s borders, but the risk for escalation remains significant,” the report says. Haines said in her testimony that the Ukraine conflict has become a “grinding attritional war in which neither side has a definitive military advantage,” but said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was likely to carry on, possibly for years.“We do not foresee the Russian military recovering enough this year to make major territorial gains, but Putin most likely calculates the time works in his favor, and that prolonging the war, including with potential pauses in the fighting, may be his best remaining pathway to eventually securing Russia’s strategic interests in Ukraine, even if it takes years,” Haines said.Haines and the other top intelligence officials – CIA Director William Burns, FBI Director Christopher Wray, Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier and NSA Director Gen. Paul Nakasone – testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee Wednesday at the panel’s annual public worldwide threats hearing.Haines ticked through the global challenges the US faces – from Russia and China to Iran and North Korea – along with risks related to cyber and technology and authoritarian governments. Haines explained that Russia will likely be unable to sustain even its currently modest level of offensive operations in Ukraine without an additional mandatory mobilization and third-party ammunition sources.“They may fully shift to holding and defending the territories they now occupy,” said HainesHaines called Putin’s “nuclear saber-rattling” an attempt to “deter the West from providing additional support to Ukraine.”“He probably will still remain confident that Russia can eventually militarily defeat Ukraine and wants to prevent Western support from tipping the balance and forcing a conflict with NATO,” she said.Still, as Russia deals with “extensive damage” from its war in Ukraine, Moscow will grow more dependent on its nuclear, cyber and space capabilities, the US intelligence agencies said in their report.Heavy losses on the battlefield in Ukraine “have degraded Moscow’s ground- and air-based conventional capabilities and increased its reliance on nuclear weapons,” the report added.“Although its cyber activity surrounding the war fell short of the pace and impact we had expected, Russia will remain a top cyber threat as it refines and employs its espionage, influence, and attack capabilities,” the report states.Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence panel, argued that TikTok presents “a substantial national security threat for the country of a kind that we didn’t face in the past.”The Chinese government could use TikTok to control data on millions of people and harness the video app to shape public opinion should China invade Taiwan, Wray told the panel Wednesday. Wray responded affirmatively to questions from Rubio on whether TikTok would allow Beijing widespread control over data and a valuable influence tool in the event of war in the Taiwan Strait.“The most fundamental piece that cuts across every one of those risks and threats that you mentioned that I think Americans need to understand is that something that’s very sacred in our country — the difference between the private sector and public sector — that’s a line that is nonexistent in the way that the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] operates,” Wray said.Rubio and Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, also pressed the intelligence leaders on the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic in light of a new Energy Department assessment, made with low confidence, that the pandemic likely was the result of a lab leak in Wuhan. Haines said the intelligence community is still seeking to collect additional information to determine the origin of the Covid-19 pandemic but reiterated there’s no consensus at this point among US intelligence agencies.“There’s a broad consensus in the intelligence community that the outbreak is not the result of a bioweapon or genetic engineering. What there isn’t a consensus on is whether or not it’s a lab leak, essentially as Director Wray indicated, or natural exposure to an infected animal,” Haines said.Collins, a proponent of the lab leak theory, argued that the two theories should not carry the same weight.“I just don’t understand why you continue to maintain on behalf of the intelligence community that these are two equally plausible explanations. They simply are not,” Collins said.Senate Intelligence Chairman Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said that the committee still had “unfinished business” with the investigation into the handling of classified documents, reiterating that the committee still needed to see the documents taken from the offices and homes of President Joe Biden, former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence. “I think I speak for everyone on both sides of the aisle on this committee, we still have unfinished business regarding the classified documents that we need to see in order for this intelligence committee to effectively oversee its job on intelligence oversights,” said Warner during his opening remarks at the committee’s annual worldwide threats hearing.Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, asked Haines and Wray why they hadn’t personally looked at all of the classified documents that were found. They responded they had both reviewed some but not all of the documents. Wray said that he had gone through a “fairly meticulous listing” of all the documents with “detailed information about the contents,” while noting the FBI had teams experienced with mishandling of classified documents cases. Cotton echoed Warner, saying that the committee’s “patience is starting to run out” with the intelligence community for not sharing the documents or even a characterization with the intelligence panel.“At least some of us are prepared to start putting our foot down if we don’t have better answers and the stonewall doesn’t stop,” Cotton said.Transnational racially and ethnically motivated extremists, including neo-Nazis and white supremacists,”remain the most lethal threat to US persons and interests,” the intelligence community said in its new report.The report says this largely “decentralized movement” poses “a significant threat to a number of US allies and partners through attacks and propaganda that espouses violence.”“These actors increasingly seek to sow social divisions, support fascist-style governments, and attack government institutions. The transnational and loose structure of RMVE organizations challenges local security services and creates a resilience against disruptions,” the report states, referring to racially or ethnically motivated violent extremist groups. The report also raises concern that a prolonged conflict in Ukraine could provide foreign racially and ethnically motivated extremists “with opportunities to gain access to battlefield experience and weapons.”“Ukraine featured heavily in online discussions among foreign RMVEs in the immediate aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, although the total number of foreign violent extremists traveling to Ukraine has been limited,” it says.Racially and ethnically motivated extremists were similarly listed as the most lethal threat to US persons and interests in the 2022 version of the intelligence community report.This story has been updated with additional information Wednesday.CNN’s Michael Conte, Sean Lyngaas, Natasha Bertrand, Matt Pittman, Christian Sierra, Brandon Shillingford and Abby Baggini contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/08/politics/us-intel-chiefs-worldwide-threats-congress/index.html

 The White House’s endorsement of a bill that would give the Biden administration new powers to restrict or ban TikTok in the United States marks a significant shift in the White House’s approach to the Chinese-owned social media app.It’s also a move that the White House has been actively mulling for several weeks while working with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to draft the legislation, Democratic and Republican aides said. US senators unveil bipartisan bill empowering Biden to ban TikTok and other services A dozen US senators unveiled legislation on Tuesday called the Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology (RESTRICT) Act. The bill does not target TikTok specifically for a ban. But it aims to give the US government new powers, up to and including a ban, against foreign-linked producers of electronics or software that the Commerce Department deems to be a national security risk.The bill was drafted in close consultation with the White House’s National Security Council as well as the Commerce, Treasury and Justice Departments, according to aides familiar with the process.The National Security Council and Department of Justice proposed specific changes to the text of the legislation, some of which were adopted, according to a Democratic and a Republican aide.The White House’s involvement in the drafting of the bill marked a shift, following more than two years during which the administration’s Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, or CFIUS, has sought to negotiate a deal with TikTok to address US national security concerns about Chinese ownership of the popular social media app.Those talks have yet to yield a deal. And the new legislation could give the White House significant new leverage in those talks or simply empower the administration to resolve the situation unilaterally.The White House’s rapid-fire endorsement of the bill came in the form of a statement from National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who said it will empower the administration “to prevent certain foreign governments from exploiting technology services operating in the United States in a way that poses risks to Americans’ sensitive data and our national security.”The White House’s involvement in drafting the legislation and its endorsement of the bill comes amid mounting pressure on Capitol Hill to take a more aggressive stance, including a bill by Sen. Marco Rubio that would outright ban TikTok.A Democratic aide said the White House recognized the need for congressional action and decided to throw their support behind Democratic Sen. Mark Warner and Republican Sen. John Thune’s approach, which would empower the administration without requiring it to ban the app.“We appreciate that some members of Congress remain willing to explore options for addressing national security concerns that don’t have the effect of censoring millions of Americans,” Brooke Oberwetter, a spokesperson for TikTok, said in a statement about the legislation. “A U.S. ban on TikTok is a ban on the export of American culture and values to the billion-plus people who use our service worldwide.”As TikTok faces confronts mounting scrutiny in the United States, it’s also dealing with scrutiny overseas.TikTok sought to reassure European users on Wednesday that their personal information will be protected from prying eyes with a series of steps the company is taking to keep that data within the European Union.TikTok will begin moving EU user data onto servers this year located in Ireland and Norway, the company said in a blog post, with the aim to complete that migration in 2024. The local data storage is expected to cost the company 1.2 billion euros a year, the company said. In addition, TikTok said it plans to require employees seeking access to EU user data to go through “security gateways” and “additional checks” intended to prevent misuse of the information.The company’s changes in Europe are part of an initiative it is calling “Project Clover,” an analogue to the US-focused “Project Texas” the company has unveiled to erect safeguards for American TikTok users and persuade US policymakers the company does not pose a national security risk. “Project Clover is a program focused on creating a secure enclave for European TikTok user data,” TikTok said in the blog post. “This initiative will introduce a number of new measures to strengthen existing protections and further align our overall approach to data governance with the principle of European data sovereignty.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

2,,"LiveRussia s war in UkraineLiveAmericans kidnapped in MexicoLiveLouisville Police reportLiveWhat s moving markets todayBy Alicia Wallace, Krystal Hur, Anna Bahney and Nicole GoodkindThe number of job openings in the United States fell to 10.8 million in January, down from an upwardly revised 11.23 million in December, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday as part of its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS.The consensus estimate from economists was for 10.5 million available positions in January, according to Refinitiv.The January JOLTS report showed that hiring increased to 6.37 million from 6.25 million, layoffs surged to 1.72 million from 1.48 million, and quits dropped to 3.89 million from 4.09 million.The continued imbalance between worker supply and demand means the US job market remained tight in January — and that s not what the Federal Reserve is looking for in its efforts to cool the economy.The Fed remains highly attuned to the monthly JOLTS report as the data can serve as a proxy for labor market demand. Fed officials have expressed concern that a tight labor market could keep upward pressure on wages and, in turn, inflation.In January, there were nearly 1.9 available jobs for every job seeker.From CNN s Nicole GoodkindUS stocks opened slightly higher on Wednesday as investors struggled for direction after commentary on Tuesday from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell about inflation rates and the state of the economy triggered a market selloff.Powell sent markets lower and 2-year Treasury yields to 15-year highs on Tuesday as he opened the door to larger rate hikes during testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin added to concerns on Wednesday morning. High inflation means the Federal Reserve still has more work to do, he said at an event in South Carolina. Chair Powell is expected to testify Wednesday at 10 a.m. ET before the House Financial Services Committee, potentially triggering a new wave of market volatility.The bond market, meanwhile, is flashing a warning sign that generally predicts an incoming recession: The yield on the two-year US Treasury moved higher than the 10-year by the most in more than 40 years. That’s a signal that investors are more nervous about the immediate future than the longer term.Tensions between the United States and China also continue to rage on, worrying investors. China announced a major government overhaul that aims to boost its technological self-reliance as a tech war with the United States intensifies. The ADP employment report, meanwhile, highlighted a still-resilient US labor market — 242,000 jobs were added in February. That s much higher than estimates of 200,000 and more than double January s revised 119,000 jobs added. Investors are waiting for US job opening numbers for January at 10 a.m. ET and government payroll numbers on Friday.In corporate news, shares of Occidental Petroleum were up 3.3% after filings showed that Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway purchased more shares of the energy company this week. Shares of Stitch Fix, meanwhile, fell nearly 10% after the clothing company missed estimates on fourth-quarter earnings. The Dow was up 36 points, or 0.1%, on Wednesday morning.The S&P 500 grew by 0.1%.The Nasdaq Composite was 0.2% higher.Online inflation continued to cool in February, with prices falling for the sixth straight month, according to a new report from Adobe Analytics.In a positive sign for inflation-weary consumers, prices slid last month by 1.4% year over year, and more than half the categories saw falling prices on an annual basis, the Adobe Digital Price Index showed. The survey showed sharp drops in discretionary categories, including electronics (down 12.6% year on year), computers (16.4%) and toys (6.5%). Appliances were down 3.8% year on year and home and garden products fell 3.8%.Grocery prices remain stubbornly high, up 11.4% year on year, but down from January’s 12.6% increase. It s the fifth consecutive month that grocery prices have slowed from their record high in September.Online prices rose for 25 straight months during the pandemic as demand surged, before slowing in July, Adobe reported. The slower pace of online inflation offers further evidence that the Federal Reserve s efforts to bring down overall prices are working, as consumers reduce their spending on goods.Private companies added more jobs than forecast in February, according to payroll company ADP.An estimated 242,000 jobs were added last month, higher than the forecast of 200,000 and more than double the revised 119,000 added in January.The labor market is a keen focus for the Federal Reserve, with the ADP report seen as a proxy for the Labor Department s monthly employment report, which is set to be released Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET.The bulk of the month s hiring occurred at mid-sized companies (50-499 employees) and large firms (500+ employees), according to the report. The job growth was fairly broad-based, with industries such as leisure and hospitality, services, and financial activities seeing some of the larger gains.Pay growth for ""job stayers"" slowed to 7.2% in February, the slowest pace seen during the past 12 months. Wage gains for workers who changed jobs also ticked down from 14.9% in January to 14.3% last month. “There is a tradeoff in the labor market right now,” said Nela Richardson, ADP s chief economist, in a statement. ""We re seeing robust hiring, which is good for the economy and workers, but pay growth is still quite elevated. The modest slowdown in pay increases, on its own, is unlikely to drive down inflation rapidly in the near term.""Stocks: US stock futures were slightly higher Wednesday after plunging Tuesdaywhen Fed Chair Jerome Powell testified that rates would rise higher than expected. Powell is set to testify again Wednesday. Dow futures were up 30 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures rose 0.1%. Nasdaq Composite futures were 0.1% higher.Fear & Greed Index: 47 = NeutralOil & gas: US oil prices were down 0.1% below $78 a barrel. Average US gas prices rose to $3.45 a gallon.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to deliver testimony to the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, the second day of his semiannual appearance before Congress to discuss the economy.Wall Street is likely hoping for a calmer day, after Tuesday s testimony before the Senate Finance Committee brought sparks and a lot of market agita when Powell said interest rate hikes are ""likely to be higher than previously anticipated.""That news sent investors reeling, with all three major indexes dropping steeply. Market expectations for a half-point rate hike spiked, shifting from a 30% probability to almost 70% by day s end, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.Investors will be looking Wednesday to see if the Fed chair doubles down on his hawkish tone and if he addresses the drop in financial markets.Since the House tends to offer more spirited discourse than the Senate, there may be some fireworks during Powell s testimony. In his last appearance before the House, in June, he admitted the Fed had been ""pretty wrong"" in its assessment of when supply-side problems linked to Covid-19 would ease.Adding to the potential drama: The highly anticipated January Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, is set to be released at the exact time Powell takes his seat, at 10 a.m. ET. Lawmakers and investors alike will be tuning in to this key data point to determine if the white-hot US labor market showed any sign of cooling at the start of the year.The job market has so far resisted the Fed s efforts to slow demand for labor: December s JOLTS data showed that despite mass layoffs in sectors like tech and media and the looming threat of recession, the number of available jobs unexpectedly rose to 11.01 million from 10.44 million in November.In additional to Fed Chair Powell s appearance on the Hill, investors are preparing for a flood of economic data Wednesday.ADP s private payroll employment report, considered a proxy for Friday s monthly employment snapshot from the Labor Department, is set to be released at 8:15 a.m.ET. The forecast is for 168,000 positions added, up from 106,000 in January. At 10 a.m. ET, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, for the month of January, is scheduled for release. The Fed has been closely watching this report as a sign of labor market tightness. In December, job openings unexpectedly rose to 11 million positions — 1.9 openings for every person looking. Later on Wednesday, the Fed will release its Beige Book, a summary of economic conditions in each of the central bank s 12 districts.Please enable JavaScript for a better experience.",https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/stock-market-house-testimony-jerome-powell-030823/index.html

 The kidnapping and killing of US travelers this week in the Mexican city of Matamoros, just over the border from Brownsville, Texas, has put a glaring spotlight on violence in a country that millions of international visitors flock to each year.And as spring break gets under way in popular beach resorts hundreds of miles away in the country’s west and south, the question of safety is likely top of mind. Here’s what to know about travel safety in Mexico:There are 32 states in Mexico, and the US State Department has “do not travel” advisories in place for six, including Tamaulipas state, where Matamoros is located. Zachary Rabinor, founder and CEO of travel company Journey Mexico, points out that this week’s violence happened far from some of the most sought-after tourist destinations in Mexico, in a state that has long held a US State Department “do not travel” warning.“To put things in perspective, Matamoros is about 1,360 miles away from Cancun; that’s about the equivalent distance from the Texas side of the border to Chicago, Illinois,” said Rabinor, whose company creates tailored luxury trips. 2 American survivors of deadly Mexico kidnapping are being treated in US hospital, officials say, as bodies of 2 killed are examined. Here s what we knowSeven Mexican states are listed one tier down in the State Department’s “reconsider travel” category and 17 are listed under “exercise increased caution.” “Crime and kidnapping” is listed as the cause for advisories in some states in each of those three categories, including Tamaulipas. The rest of the advisories list “crime” as the reason to either not travel, reconsider or exercise caution.“Exercise normal precautions” is the guidance for the states of Campeche and Yucatán on the Yucatán Peninsula.Countries including Canada and the United Kingdom also have detailed travel warnings related to Mexico.Playa del Carmen and Cancún, which are welcoming an influx of spring break travelers, are located in the state of Quintana Roo, where the State Department advises travelers to “exercise increased caution due to crime and kidnapping.”Rabinor highlighted other popular destinations carrying the “exercise increased caution” advisory, including France and the Bahamas. France receives the caution because of possible terrorism and civil unrest. Crime is listed as the reason for caution in the Bahamas.The State Department notes in its Quintana Roo advisory that violence and criminal activity may occur anywhere, “including in popular tourist destinations.”It is relatively safe for travelers to head to tourist destinations and major urban centers such as Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey.Security expert Jaime Lopez-Aranda“Travelers should maintain a high level of situational awareness, avoid areas where illicit activities occur, and promptly depart from potentially dangerous situations,” the advisory warns.Those popular resort areas are still reasonably safe, says Jaime Lopez-Aranda, who is a senior security manager at travel risk management firm International SOS. “It is relatively safe for travelers to head to tourist destinations and major urban centers such as Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey,” Lopez-Aranda told CNN Travel. Lopez-Aranda lives in Mexico City, where petty crime is a persistent risk and precautions should be taken, he said, “but the most popular locations are relatively safe for all kinds of travelers.”Journey Mexico has more than 50 employees based in the country who are always monitoring for potential risk, Rabinor said.“We are confident that with proper preparation and information, travel to and within Mexico continues to be a great option,” he said.If January’s international flight arrivals are any indication, the risks associated with travel to parts of Mexico aren’t keeping visitors away from the country as a whole.Passenger arrivals on international flights were up by 13% in January compared with January 2019, before the pandemic took hold around the world.Medical tourism to Mexico is on the rise, but it can come with risksCaution and situational awareness are key all over the country – and the world for that matter.For travel in Mexico, Lopez-Aranda says precautions could include:• Traveling with a trusted driver in a private vehicle• Traveling only in daylight hours outside urban centers or in higher-risk locations• Avoiding trouble spots in major cities• Avoiding traveling alone• Staying up-to-date through news and government alerts• Making sure your mobile device is chargedAll of those tips are measures to take at a destination, but much of the work that goes into ensuring the safest possible trip happens before anything is even booked. Izamal: Yucatán s magical  Yellow City You’ll want to research the security and medical risks of destinations you’re considering and make sure that you have confidence in your accommodations, transport, means of communication and security arrangements, says Lopez-Aranda.“It is important that you share all plans with friends and family at home. While traveling, you should also keep constant communication to ensure safety and discuss any potential risks that may arise,” he says.And you should have copies of your documents, contact information for your country’s embassy or consulate and the location of the closest hospital with you. Insurance that covers you in your destination is also key.Journey Mexico links to the US State Department advisories on its website, as well as travel guidance for the citizens of other countries including the United Kingdom and Australia.The company also notes conflicts between rival criminal organizations in various areas of Mexico in its own “Is Mexico Safe?” safety assessment. “Though these conflicts can be unpredictable, they are almost always among and between organized crime groups” and are very rare in tourist areas, the posting says. The site also includes precautions travelers can take to avoid pickpocketing or robbery, including using ATMs only in secure locations, hiring reputable private transportation, not wearing expensive jewelry and avoiding deserted, unlit areas.If you’re uncomfortable, try to get away from the situation or environment immediately, says Lopez-Aranda.Because “intuition is often right.” © 2023 Cable News Network.

7,,"A school board voted Wednesday evening to oust its superintendent, weeks after a 6-year-old allegedly shot a teacher in one of the district’s schools and on the same day that the teacher’s lawyer said school administrators were warned that the child had a gun the day of the shooting.The Newport News Public Schools school board voted 5-1 in favor of a separation agreement and severance with Superintendent Dr. George Parker III. The teacher’s lawyer alleged earlier Wednesday that school administrators had multiple warnings about the boy the day of the incident. “Over the course of a few hours, three different times – three times – school administration was warned by concerned teachers and employees that the boy had a gun on him at the school and was threatening people,” Diane Toscano, an attorney for the teacher, Abby Zwerner, told reporters in a news conference Wednesday. “But the administration could not be bothered.”Pediatricians are giving out free gun locks to approach the gun violence epidemic as a public health crisis“Abby and these other teachers at Richneck Elementary School tried to do the right thing on January 6,” Toscano said, adding she intended to file a lawsuit on Zwerner’s behalf. Toscano alleged the administration “failed to act” despite the fact they had “knowledge of imminent danger.” The school’s assistant principal, Dr. Ebony Parker, resigned Wednesday, a spokesperson for the school district told CNN. CNN has reached out to the school district for comment on Toscano’s claims.A 6-year-old boy was taken into custody January 6 after he brought his mother’s legally purchased gun to the school in his backpack and shot his first grade teacher, Abby Zwerner, police said at the time.23 years ago, another 6-year-old boy fired a gun in school. The victim was his classmate Zwerner, 25, was initially in critical condition and later stabilized before being released from the hospital after a bullet went through her hand and into her chest inside her classroom. Police have said the shooting was intentional.According to Toscano, a bit before 11:30 a.m. that day, Zwerner informed an administrator that the 6-year-old had “threatened to beat up another child.” Administration did not remove the student from class or call security, Toscano claimed. Around 12:30 p.m., another teacher told the administrator she believed the student had put a gun in his pocket and taken it out to recess, Toscano claimed. The administrator allegedly “downplayed” the possibility, Toscano said, responding that the boy had “little pockets.” Then, shortly after 1 p.m., a third teacher told administrators that another child – described by Toscano as “crying and fearful” – had informed the teacher the 6-year-old “showed him the gun at recess and threatened to shoot him if he told anybody.” A fourth employee then asked the administration for permission to search the boy but was denied, Toscano claimed. Zwerner was shot almost an hour later, her attorney said.The family of the 6-year-old continues to “pray for Ms. Zwerner and wish her a complete and full recovery,” an attorney representing the family told CNN in a statement Wednesday. “Our hearts go out to all involved.” Since the shooting, the school board has had several meetings, including a heated one last week where members faced backlash from parents. The school board also met in a closed discussion Tuesday after which they decided to host a special meeting Wednesday.Parker’s last day as superintendent will be February 1, and an interim superintendent will step in. He has been superintendent of the district since 2018, according to the district’s website. CNN has reached out to Parker’s office for comment.The school will reopen January 30, nearly a month after the shooting, school officials confirmed to CNN in an email earlier this week. During the intense board meeting with parents on January 17, emotions were high as frustrated parents spoke about the fear and anxiety their children have been enduring since the gun violence. At least one parent called on the superintendent’s position to be reevaluated. “Why did it take negative national attention before you took this seriously and actually reevaluated?” the parent asked. “I think it’s time the citizens and parents of Newport News who did not elect you to reevaluate your services as our, our superintendent.”The shooting came as America continues to grapple with the ubiquitous issue of gun violence permeating many public spaces around the country. The shooting at Richneck Elementary was the first of 2023 at a US school, according to a CNN analysis. In 2022, there were 60 shootings at K-12 schools, the CNN analysis shows.Still, school shootings by a suspect so young are very rare. There have been three other cases in which the suspect was as young as 6: in 2000, 2011 and 2021, according to the K-12 School Shooting Database, which has tracked shootings in American schools since 1970.The shooting at the elementary school happened after an altercation between the teacher and the student, who pointed the gun at the teacher and fired a single round, said Newport News Police Chief Steve Drew. “There was no physical struggle or fight,” Drew said at the time, adding no other students were involved.The boy was placed under temporary detention order and was evaluated at a local hospital.Nearly two weeks after the shooting, the boy’s family released their first statement, expressing praise for the teacher. Gun allegedly used by 6-year-old to shoot teacher kept on top shelf of mother s closet, attorney says“Our heart goes out to our son’s teacher and we pray for her healing in the aftermath of such an unimaginable tragedy as she selflessly served our son and the children in the school,” the family said in the statement released through attorney James Ellenson.The family pointed out their son suffers from a disability, and he was receiving care at the school. “Our son suffers from an acute disability and was under a care plan at the school that included his mother or father attending school with him and accompanying him to Class every day,” the family statement says. The family also said the gun allegedly used was secured before the shooting. They said a family member usually went to class with him, but not the week of the shooting.It s an awkward conversation, but you have to talk to other parents about guns, experts say“We will regret our absence on this day for the rest of our lives,” the family statement said. Meanwhile, the police chief has indicated the boy’s mother could possibly face charges in the shooting. “And at the end of the day, when that’s all compiled together and the facts and what the law supports, the Commonwealth’s attorney will make the decision if there are any charges forthcoming … towards the parents,” Drew said.Under Virginia law, it’s a misdemeanor for an adult leaves a loaded, unsecured firearm in such a way it could endanger a child under the age of 14.

 This week, Microsoft confirmed it’s planning to invest billions in OpenAI, the company behind the viral new chatbot tool ChatGPT. The prospect of Microsoft, maker of software that people mostly hate, getting involved with ChatGPT, a product people generally like, is raising a lot of eyebrows. Almost immediately, people began joking on social media that ChatGPT could be used to revive the broadly maligned, big-eyed goon known as Clippy. In case anyone forgot, Clippy was Microsoft’s dumb little virtual assistant who used to pop up offering to help you format your English Lit essay. Clippy was cute, like a cartoon dog, and had an intelligence to match. Perhaps the genuinely impressive tech underpinning ChatGPT could do what Clippy never could and offer, like, actual help, rather than just pop up unannounced with that dopey half-surprised look on its face. My colleague Samantha Murphy Kelly spoke to AI experts about the prospect of a Microsoft-ChatGPT partnership.“There is a kernel of truth to the Clippy comparison,” David Lobina, an artificial intelligence analyst at ABI Research, told Sam. “ChatGPT is a rather sophisticated auto-completion tool, and in that sense it is a much better version of Clippy.”ICYMI: Since November, ChatGPT has simultaneously impressed and horrified pretty much everyone whose job centers on content creation or the assessment thereof — journalists, academics, teachers, publishers, entertainers, anyone who composes emails or presents information. This bot does everything — songs, poems, essays, news stories, news stories in the style of 1920s muckraker, news stories in the stream-of-consciousness style of Virginia Woolf, whatever your heart desires. It can write your dumb emails for you. It can craft a speech. Your wedding vows. A cover letter for a job application.That AI power is, understandably, an intriguing proposition for Microsoft, maker of some of the world’s most despised and yet ubiquitous software such as Outlook, Word and Excel. Per Sam: Some potential use cases include writing lines of text for a PowerPoint presentation, drafting an essay in Word or doing automatic data entry in Excel spreadsheets. For Microsoft’s search engine Bing, ChatGPT could provide more personalized search results and better summarize web pages. All of the above suggestions were generated by asking ChatGPT various forms of the question, “How could Microsoft integrate ChatGPT into its products?” Argh, Samantha, you scamp! Anyway, Microsoft, hasn’t publicly offered any clues about its plans beyond saying it would integrate ChatGPT features to its cloud computing service. Even without details, it’s interesting that Microsoft, Silicon Valley’s equivalent of a Boomer, suddenly appears to be a frontrunner in Big Tech’s AI race. Google was reportedly caught off guard by the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership, and it stirred up some frustration for Meta’s head of AI. Of course, AI tech is still young, unreliable and rife with ethical quandaries. “Systems such as ChatGPT can be rather unreliable, making up stuff as they go and giving different answers to the same questions — not to mention the sexist and racist biases,” Lobina says. Which raises the prospect of an anthropomorphic paper clip helper who could genuinely help you but also genuinely be as problematic and biased as the internet matter from which its brain is built. Amazon is creeping deeper into our personal lives, for better or worse. The company — already keenly attuned to your incessant demand for dog toys, moisturizer, running socks, even your semi-annual compulsion to rewatch every episode of Fleabag in a single sitting — is getting even more personal with its latest offering. See here: Amazon just rolled out a $5-a-month subscription service offering 60 common generic prescription drugs for dozens of common conditions, including high blood pressure, anxiety, depression, and hair loss.The new delivery service, RxPass, launched this week across most of the US (A few states, including California and Texas, are excluded because they have unique requirements for prescription deliveries). For folks with multiple medications, this could be a game changer. The idea is that for just five bucks a month, you can get all the drugs you need (the generic versions, anyway). That’s five bucks total, not five bucks in addition to the cost of the medicine. It’s a flat rate, regardless of how many prescriptions you have. The catch? RxPass is an add-on for Amazon Prime memberships, which cost $139 a year. So, if you’re not already on the Prime train, that might seem steep. Also, people on government health plans like Medicare and Medicaid aren’t eligible. Amazon has been moving steadily into health care, minus a few stumbles (we’re looking at you, Amazon Care), for years. It launched an online pharmacy in 2020, and it is in the process of acquiring One Medical, a boutique primary care provider. The bottom line: As for Amazon, this program is almost certainly a loss-maker, analysts say. But it’s a smart one for a company whose value boils down to the fact that consumers are addicted to it. If RxPass works, and we all start getting our dog food and our anti-depressants in the same box every month, that’ll be true both literally and metaphorically.

 Tesla reported record profits for the fourth quarter and the full year, but its profit margins were tighter due to higher costs, recent price cuts, and sales in the quarter that were weaker than hoped.The leading electric vehicle maker posted adjusted earnings of $1.19 per share in the quarter, up from 85 cents a share a year earlier, and its previous record of $1.07 a share in the first quarter. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had forecast EPS of $1.13. For the full year, the company had adjusted earnings per share of $4.07, up from $2.26 in 2021. But the closely-watched automotive gross margin fell to 25.9% from 27.9% in the third quarter and 30.6% in the fourth quarter a year ago.Tesla gets hundreds of million dollars each year selling the governmental credits it receives for selling only zero-emission cars. Traditional automakers, which still sell primarily gasoline-powered cars, buy those credits from Tesla in order to avoid fines for not meeting strict emissions rules. Many auto analysts strip out those credits when calculating the profit margins Tesla achieves on its automotive operations.When those credits are excluded, Tesla’s automotive gross margin fell to 24.3% in the quarter, a couple percentage points below many estimates, and down from 26.8% in the third quarter and 29.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021.Its revenue edged past forecasts, however, rising 37% from a year earlier to $24.3 billion in the quarter. The consensus forecast was for revenue of $24.2 billion. Tesla set a sales target 1.8 million vehicles for this year, up 37% from 2022 sales of 1.3 million vehicles. Still, that would be the company’s slowest percentage growth since 2020, when the first year of the pandemic upended sales.CEO Elon Musk said the price cuts announced late last year and earlier this year has spurred demand for its cars and that orders are now outpacing production by a two-to-one margin.“The most common question we’ve been getting from investors is about demand,” he said. “I want to put that concern to rest,” adding that this is the strongest January sales the company has ever seen.“We think demand will be good despite probably a contraction in the automotive market as a whole,” Musk said. “So basically, price really matters. I think there’s just a vast number of people that want to buy a Tesla car but can’t afford it. And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer.”Musk said Tesla would have capacity to make about 2 million cars this year, if everything goes smoothly. But he said he can’t count on that, especially after disruptions in recent years.“It just always seems to be some force majeure thing that happened somewhere on Earth. And we don’t control if there’s like earthquakes, tsunamis, wars, pandemics, et cetera,” he said. “So if it’s a smooth year, actually, without some big supply chain interruption or massive problem, we actually have the potential to do 2 million cars this year. We’re not committing to that but I’m just saying that’s the potential. And I think there would be demand for that, too.”The company’s statement and Musk acknowledged that there are economic and other uncertainties ahead that could affect 2023 results. During the call, Musk made reference several times to the risk of a recession this year, but said the company is well positioned to ride out such an economic downturn, with plenty of cash on hand. The company’s statement also referred to recession risks.“We know that there are questions about the near-term impact of an uncertain macroeconomic environment, and in particular, with rising interest rates,” it said in the earnings statement. “We are prepared for short-term uncertainty, while being focused on the long-term potential of autonomy, electrification and energy solutions.”Tesla(TSLA) shares were up more than 5% in after-hours trading after its report and conference call with investors. Tesla’s once high-flying shares lost 65% of their value last year, the worst year ever for the company’s usually high-flying stock, in part becauseit failed to hit its target of a 50% growth in sales in 2022. The company’s previous aggressive growth rates and strong profit margins were factors that made Tesla the most valuable automaker in the world by far, despite having a fraction of the sales volume of other global automakers.The automaker’s previously announced sales shortfall was attributed greatly to Covid-related shutdowns, which caused the shutdown not only its Shanghai factory, but many of its stores and suppliers in China. Consumer Reports calls Ford s automated driving tech much better than Tesla sTesla also faces questions about when it will debut new products. A year ago Musk said that the company couldn’t debut long-promised new vehicles, such as the Cybertruck pickup, due to supply chain issues that forced it to concentrate on its existing product line. The company reiterated in its report Wednesday that it expects to begin production of the Cybertruck later this year. It had previously said volume production of that vehicle is expected in 2024. Tesla also said it will reveal details of its next generation vehicle platform at an investors’ day in March.Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

 UK car manufacturing hit a 66-year low in 2022, as the closure of two plants, a global shortage of semiconductors and the effect of Covid lockdowns in China on auto supply chains crippled output. Figures published Thursday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), an industry body, showed that the number of passenger cars made in Britain declined 10% year-on-year to hit 775,014. That’s the lowest total since 1956, and 41% down on the 1.3 million cars made in 2019 before the pandemic.The UK auto industry has suffered a series of setbacks recently, including the closure of Honda’s(HMC) Swindon plant in 2021 and BMW’s(BMWYY) announcement in October that it will end production of the electric Mini in Oxford this year. The plant will produce internal combustion engine vehicles until those are banned in 2030.The latest blow came last week when homegrown battery startup Britishvolt entered administration, the UK equivalent of filing for bankruptcy. Britishvolt’s demise poses questions about whether auto manufacturing has a future in Britain if it doesn’t have the batteries it needs to power electric vehicles. The company was planning to build a £3.8 billion ($4.7 billion) gigafactory in the north of England, which once complete would have produced enough batteries for over 300,000 electric vehicles a year, equivalent to nearly 40% of current UK vehicle production.Its failure leaves Chinese-backed Envision AESC, which supplies Nissan(NSANF), as the only UK-based manufacturer of electric vehicle batteries ahead of the looming ban on the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles in 2030. Hybrids are set to be banned from 2035. Andy Palmer, the former Aston Martin CEO, called Britishvolt’s collapse an “unmitigated disaster for the auto industry in the UK.” In an interview with the BBC, Palmer said the United Kingdom does not have the battery capacity to support the government’s electric vehicle ambitions. “That means that ultimately British car manufacturing will migrate to where the batteries are. That is going to be in central Europe,” he added. Other experts are far less gloomy, but in the wake of Britishvolt’s collapse, UK lawmakers have launched an inquiry into the viability of electric vehicle battery manufacturing in the United Kingdom.“The future of car manufacturing in the UK is dependent on our ability to make electric vehicles, and to be able to export them into the EU,” Darren Jones, chair of the House of Commons business committee, said in a statement. “That means we need local supplies of electric vehicle batteries — something we’re falling significantly behind on compared to other parts of the world.”Researchers at the Faraday Institution, Britain’s flagship battery-research program, estimated last June that by 2030, more than 1.5 million electric vehicles would be produced in the UK demanding more than 100 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery capacity annually — the equivalent of five large gigafactories running at full capacity. As it stands, Britain has just 36.9 GWh of capacity planned for 2030, according to the report.By contrast, European gigafactory capacity projected for 2030 is expected to reach over 1,100 GWh across more than 40 plants. The largest planned is Tesla(TSLA)’s battery plant in Germany. “The UK is making progress but not moving fast enough compared to its competitors in Europe and beyond,” the researchers said in the report. UK car sales slump to 30-year low Gigafactories take years to build, so car makers will be deciding in the next two to three years whether to locate future electric vehicle production in the UK or Europe, they added.The US Inflation Reduction Act, which provides tax breaks for companies in America that make parts for green energy projects, will only make competition more intense.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, SMMT CEO Mike Hawes said that the UK government has “got to do something” to respond to the inflation act, which is going to “suck investment” into America’s electric vehicle industry. The government must also address soaring energy costs through subsidies and incentivize investment in zero emission technologies, including batteries, according to Hawes.There’s another reason the industry may already be suffering a slow death: Brexit. Years of uncertainty over the terms of a trade deal diverted investment towards Brexit contingency plans and away from new technologies.And risks remain. Under the Brexit trade deal that eventually replaced EU membership, tougher “rules of origin” requirements take effect next year. They will require that a greater proportion of the parts in electric vehicles traded between Britain and the European Union are sourced from one of the two regions in order to avoid costly tariffs. Neither side is ready to meet the deadline, according to Hawes. “The relationship between the UK and the EU, especially as you electrify, is still fundamental to the success of UK car manufacturing,” he said.Despite mounting challenges, Hawes is optimistic about the future of auto manufacturing in Britain and expects car production to return to above 1 million over the next two years. UK factories made a record 234,066 electric vehicles in 2022, almost a third of all UK car production.He said that the collapse of Britishvolt was “disappointing” but “not the end of the world.”“I think there’s a danger that we talk ourselves down too much on the back of Britishvolt,” he added, noting that the startup’s site is likely to attract another investor given its proximity to an abundance of renewable energy and access to a deepwater port. More than a dozen companies, including carmakers, have already expressed an interest in buying the land, the Financial Times reported.Aston Martin and Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India’s Tata Motors(TTM), are also positive about the prospects for electric vehicle manufacturing in the United Kingdom.Jaguar Land Rover announced Wednesday that it is transforming its Solihull facility between Birmingham and Coventry to make electric Jaguars and Range Rovers. “Our continued investment in our UK facilities … will herald an exciting new era of electric car production in the UK,” the company said.Aston Martin, which sells about 6,000 vehicles a year, told CNN that Britishvolt’s failure will have no impact on its electrification strategy, with the launch of the first pure electric Aston Martin targeted for 2025.

12,,"Cybercriminals have in recent months stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of shipments from US food suppliers by placing fraudulent orders for milk products, the FBI and other federal agencies warned on Friday. The unnamed criminal groups set up email accounts impersonating top executives of food companies and convinced their suppliers to ship them truckloads of powdered milk, according to the advisory from the FBI, Food and Drug Administration, and Department of Agriculture.In some cases, the suppliers had already shipped well over $100,000 of milk products before realizing they had been conned, prompting the federal agencies to urge companies to “consider taking steps to protect their brand and reputation.”It’s the latest example of a type of fraud known as business email compromise (BEC) that has cost Americans far more than any other type of online crime. The FBI received nearly 20,000 BEC complaints last year with estimated losses of $2.4 billion. In some cases, big pots of federal money have been stolen. In August, someone tricked officials in Lexington, Kentucky, into wiring them $4 million in federal funding that was meant for housing assistance BEC attacks, however, don’t command the same national attention as ransomware attacks – which lock victims’ computers until a ransom is paid – because they are less noticeable and don’t create disruptions like computer outages. And while multimillion-dollar ransom payments grab headlines, BEC thefts can be smaller sums for individual victims. But the rampant nature of BEC theft is a top concern for FBI and Secret Service agents. “We’re talking billions of dollars in loss, and it’s life-impacting loss that a lot of these are having,” Stephen Dougherty, a Secret Service official who investigates BEC fraud, previously told CNN. He oversees a team of agents that investigates BEC fraud around the world and tries to intercept fraudulent money transfers before it’s too late.As of August, the Secret Service said it had prevented it about $30 million in losses from BEC scams this year. But timing is critical for thwarting fraudulent wire transfers. “If these aren’t reported to us quickly, chances are slim we can get a recovery,” Dougherty said.And BEC fraudsters are increasingly targeting the shipment of goods, and not just wire transfers, as the FBI advisory makes clear. “We’ve been seeing a rapidly growing number of BEC attacks impersonating external third parties, primarily supposed vendors or suppliers,” Crane Hassold, a former behavioral analyst at the FBI, told CNN.“If a company produces or sells a tangible [business-to-business] product, they’re a potential target of an attack like this,” said Hassold, who is now director of threat intelligence at cybersecurity firm Abnormal Security. © 2023 Cable News Network.

 The Biden administration announced plans Friday to provide nearly 2 million barrels of oil to refineries through an emergency exchange and simultaneously begin efforts to replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve early next year.The new emergency exchange is aimed at addressing “potential supply disruptions” caused by the shutdown of the Keystone Pipeline due to a leak earlier this month, the Energy Department said. Part of that key pipeline remains shuttered and no timeline has been issued for a full reopening.Emergency exchanges allow oil refineries to borrow oil from the SPR for a short period due to supply disruptions such as hurricanes or pipeline outages. Unlike with emergency sales such as the record-setting release of 180 million barrels announced in March, this oil must be returned.In this case, the Energy Department agreed to provide 1.2 million barrels of oil from the SPR to ExxonMobil and 600,000 barrels to Phillips 66.At the same time, the Biden administration is beginning plans to repurchase crude oil for the SPR for the first time since that unprecedented release earlier this year. The Energy Department is planning to solicit bids to repurchase up to 3 million barrels of oil for the SPR to be delivered in February, the senior administration official said. The repurchase will pilot a new approach to buy back the oil at a fixed price, the official said.“Small but a signal that pledges to refill are credible,” former Obama energy official Jason Bordoff said on Twitter in response to the new steps.The senior administration official conceded it will take months or even years to refill the SPR, whose stockpiles are at the lowest level in 38 years. Comprised of underground salt caverns in Texas and Louisiana, the SPR is the world’s largest supply of emergency crude oil. It has been used during times of war and natural disaster to ease supply crunches.The move to begin to refill the SPR — and to lock in a price — comes as oil prices have plunged to one-year lows amid recession fears.“This repurchase is an opportunity to secure a good deal for American taxpayers by repurchasing oil at a lower price than the $96 per barrel average price it was sold for, as well as to strengthen energy security,” the Energy Department said in a statement.The administration announced in October that it planned to repurchase oil for the SPR when prices are at or below roughly $67-$72 a barrel. Officials said at the time such a move would help boost demand and provide the oil industry with an incentive to keep pumping even during times of stress.Oil prices dropped nearly 4% on Friday morning to as low as $73.33 a barrel. Oil trimmed its losses after the Energy Department announced the SPR moves, with crude recently trading down 1.5% to $75 a barrel.Prices are currently in a “very useful” range to begin the process of refilling the SPR, the senior administration official said.Officials stressed that the efforts to refill the SPR won’t prevent future emergency releases in the future, if necessary.“The SPR remains ready to respond to energy security needs today. We will be prepared and as nimble as we can to make sure the SPR is doing everything it can on behalf of energy security and American consumers,” the senior administration official said.The Energy Department also took a bit of a victory lap for the decision to release 180 million barrels of oil following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Noting that gas prices are now at 15-month lows, the senior administration official said that historic release “helped provide some breathing room for American families at the pump,” the official said.

(CNN and Warner Bros. Pictures share parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.)The teaser for the live-action, Greta Gerwig-directed movie opens with an earth-toned parody of “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Young girls play peacefully in a desert with their baby dolls. A narrator intones: “Since the beginning of time, since the first little girl ever existed, there have been dolls. But the dolls were always and forever baby dolls. Until …” A colossal Barbie appears in the landscape, wearing the striped swimsuit first seen when Mattel launched the toy in 1959, and the girls turn on their outdated dolls.The promo then transitions into quick snippets of Barbie’s fluorescent pink dream world before closing with a choreographed dance number.A blonde Ryan Gosling makes an appearance as Barbie’s tanned, toned and plastic boyfriend, Ken. Gerwig co-wrote the script for the film with Noah Baumbach.

16,,"The Senate voted on Thursday to pass sweeping legislation that would authorize $858 billion in national defense funding and rescind the US military’s Covid vaccine mandate.Now that it has passed the Senate, the measure is cleared for President Joe Biden’s signature. The House already approved the measure – a final negotiated version of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2023, which sets the policy agenda and authorizes funding for the Department of Defense. As part of its $858 billion topline for national defense funding, the measure authorizes $817 billion specifically for the Department of Defense. The massive bill includes a vast number of policy provisions. Among them, it would authorize a 4.6% pay raise for military service members. It includes provisions to strengthen air power and land warfare defense capabilities as well as cybersecurity. It also aims to bolster US support for Ukraine and NATO.The provision to rescind the military’s Covid vaccine mandate comes after congressional Republicans pushed for its repeal. House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy has praised the provision, saying, “the end of President Biden’s military COVID vaccine mandate is a victory for our military and for common sense.”Prior to a vote on final passage, the Senate took some amendment votes.One proposed amendment was a measure offered by Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and other conservatives that would reinstate members of the military who were discharged for refusing to get Covid-19 vaccines. The amendment did not pass, however. Here s what s in the $858 billion defense billThe underlying defense bill does rescind the vaccine mandate for the military but does not reinstate those service members.The White House declined to say last week whether Biden would sign the must-pass annual defense bill if it includes the provision to rescind the military Covid vaccine mandate, reiterating that the president continues to support a mandate but leaving the door open to a repeal.But while White House officials have deferred to – and explicitly sided with – Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s opposition to rescinding the mandate, the inclusion of the provision in the final compromise agreement underscores a reality that played out behind the scenes in recent days. Democrats concluded that including the GOP priority was a necessity in order to get the must-pass policy bill across the finish line. And White House officials have quietly acknowledged that means their opposition to the vaccine language will not get in the way of the bill’s passage.The final version of the defense policy bill is the product of lengthy negotiations between key House and Senate lawmakers. The bill outlines the policy agenda for the Department of Defense and the US military and authorizes spending in line with the Pentagon’s priorities, though the legislation does not appropriate the funding itself.This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correctly attribute who was behind efforts to include an amendment that would reinstate members of the military who did not receive a Covid-19 vaccine. The measure was offered by Sen. Ron Johnson and other Senate conservatives.CNN’s Manu Raju contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/15/politics/ndaa-defense-bill-government-funding/index.html
17,,"Detained American Paul Whelan expressed his frustration that more has not been done to secure his release in an exclusive CNN interview hours after another detained American, Brittney Griner, was freed.Whelan said he was happy that Griner was released, but told CNN, “I am greatly disappointed that more has not been done to secure my release, especially as the four year anniversary of my arrest is coming up.”“I was arrested for a crime that never occurred,” he said in a phone call from the penal colony where he is being held in a remote part of Russia. “I don’t understand why I’m still sitting here.”The interview took place shortly after President Joe Biden, standing alongside Griner’s wife Cherelle at the White House,also expressed regret that the US had not been able to get Whelan out. Biden vowed the US would “never give up” on him. US officials said the Russians refused to negotiate his release.“This was not a situation where we had a choice of which American to bring home. It was a choice between bringing home one particular American – Brittney Griner – or bringing home none,” a US senior administration official said Thursday morning.Whelan said he was surprised that he had been left behind.“I was led to believe that things were moving in the right direction, and that the governments were negotiating and that something would happen fairly soon,” he said.Whelan, a former marine who is a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen, was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. He was convicted and sentenced in June 2020 to 16 years in prison in a trial US officials denounced as unfair.US officials have indicated that the Russians refused to release him despite US efforts at negotiations, and Whelan said he was told that because the Russians have accused him of being a spy, “they’ve put me at a level higher than what they did with Trevor (Reed) and Brittney.” WNBA star Brittney Griner released from Russian detention in prisoner swap for convicted arms dealer“That raises a lot of concerns because none of it is true. And they’re trying to get out of United States, what the United States may not be able to provide, but this is basically political extortion,” he said.He said he was aware that he was considered in a different category than Griner – “the Russians have always said so.”“They’ve always considered me to be at a higher level than other criminals of my sort and for whatever reason, I’m treated differently than another individual here from a Western country that’s also on a charge of espionage. So even though we’re both here for espionage, I’m treated much differently than he is, and my treatment is also much different than others held for espionage at other prisons,” Whelan said. Whelan said he hopes that Biden and his administration “would do everything they could to get me home, regardless of the price they might have to pay at this point.”“I would say that if a message could go to President Biden, that this is a precarious situation that needs to be resolved quickly,” he said.“My bags are packed. I’m ready to go home. I just need an airplane to come and get me,” he said.Whelan said he would like to speak to Biden directly, noting he had spoken to an administration official earlier in the day about the situation, but “I think that message really needs to go to people like the president so they understand personally what I’m dealing with and what we deal with in these foreign prisons and under these circumstances.”“It’s quite obvious that I’m being held hostage,” he said.Biden acknowledged the Whelan family on Thursday, saying that the prisoner swap for Griner was “not a choice of which American to bring home.”“Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul’s case differently than Brittney’s,” Biden said. “And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul’s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up.”The Biden administration has ideas about “new forms of offers” they are going to try with the Russians in an effort to secure Whelan’s release, a senior administration official said.The official said there is a recognition that the US needs to make available “something more, something different” from what they have offered to the Russians thus far.Whelan told CNN that “the president and his team are going to have to look at what they have that is valuable that these people want, and hopefully give it to them, or I’ll be here for a long time.” The official didn’t count out the US offering a Russian spy in US custody as a potential offer, as Russia views Whelan as a spy.“There is a willingness to pay even a very big price on the part of this president,” the official said. “We have made clear to the Russians, that we at least are open to talking about that which is at our disposal, that which we could actually deliver. It would be somebody in our custody.” Brother of Paul Whelan reacts after sibling remains detained in RussiaBiden spoke with Paul Whelan’s sister, Elizabeth Whelan, on Thursday afternoon, she told CNN, describing it as a “good call.” She said they spoke for about 10 minutes, and that she also spoke with Secretary of State Antony Blinken for about 15 minutes.She praised the release of Griner, saying that she didn’t want the news of her brother being left behind to overshadow the good news about the WNBA player.Elizabeth Whelan said she believes the Russians wanted to deny Biden a win by releasing both of the American wrongful detainees. Elizabeth Whelan also told CNN that she does not believe her brother knows the extent of the efforts to free him, noting the family has to be careful what they tell him because they assume the Russian authorities are listening. She also noted that the foreign country is always going to paint news in their own favor, so Paul Whelan likely won’t know the full picture until he is freed.National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby said Thursday that the US is “not back to square one” in its negotiations for Whelan’s release.“We have been in active discussions with the Russians on Mr. Whelan’s case for a very, very long time. Certainly those conversations accelerated in recent months and I can assure you that we are going to stay at those active discussions going forward,” Kirby told CNN’s Kate Bolduan.Asked if he thought he would face repercussions for speaking to CNN, Whelan said he didn’t think so.“I’m not trying to shine a negative light on Russia per se, I’m just trying to tell it how it is. I’m trying to get a message through to my governments that I need help,” he said.“If it is a risk, then it’s a risk I am willing to take because I think the message needs to get out,” he added. “And I’ve kind of sat quietly by for a long time, and at this point I’m frustrated that nothing’s being done, and I just don’t know what roadmap people are looking at to get me home,” Whelan said.Whelan expressed concern that he might not make it back to see his family in the United States, noting he has 12 years left in his prison sentence.“My parents are older, my dog is 14 and a half. If I’m stuck here much longer, I’m in danger of never seeing any of them again,” he said.Whelan is also worried that he himself might not make it out, telling CNN, “to be quite honest, in these conditions, who knows how I’ll come back or if I’ll come back.”He described the penal colony as “better than most in Russia because it’s mostly foreigners held here, but the conditions are extremely bad.”“We only have cold water. Everywhere is dirty. There really isn’t any maintenance. Things are extremely old, you know, 30-40-50 years old, and you know, what isn’t broken doesn’t work. We don’t have cleaning supplies. The medical care is substandard at best. And we’re really on our own to take care of ourselves,” he said.Whelan also noted that the war in Ukraine has created intense mistrust among the other prisoners about Americans, and with the Russians “saying that I’m a general in the US military, that I’m a spy, a secret agent with the DIA, that’s left me in a very precarious situation, because people look at me in a very dangerous time and say, ‘well, you’re one of them.’”Whelan said he tries to keep sane by reading “a lot of books” and writing letters. He said he likes to receive letters and cards, “sports scores and news articles and things like that,” because “that sort of thing coming in for our world makes me remember that our world still exists.”CNN’s Kylie Atwood, Haley Britzky and Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/politics/paul-whelan-cnn-interview-brittney-griner/index.html
18,,"Investigators in the killings of four University of Idaho students are searching for at least one person they believe was inside a white sedan seen near the crime scene around the time of the deaths last month, police said Wednesday.A 2011-2013 Hyundai Elantra was spotted “in the immediate area” of the off-campus home where the students were stabbed to death in the early morning hours of November 13, Moscow Police said in a statement Wednesday. Information about the vehicle came from the thousands of tips police have received in the case, which has appalled the small college town of Moscow, Idaho. Letters from surviving roommates read at church memorial service for slain University of Idaho students“Investigators believe the occupant(s) of this vehicle may have critical information to share regarding this case,” the police statement said, noting it had an unknown license plate.The students – Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Madison Mogen, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Kernodle’s boyfriend, Ethan Chapin, 20 – were killed just days before the school’s Thanksgiving break. They were all stabbed multiple times and were likely asleep when the attack began, a coroner has said.Nearly a month after the quadruple homicide, authorities have not named a suspect or located a weapon, which they believe to be a knife.Still, investigators maintain they have made progress but cannot share details as that could compromise the investigation.“We’re continuously making progress,” Idaho State Police spokesperson Aaron Snell told CNN. “But this is a criminal investigation, and as we make progress, we can’t always provide that information.”Investigators are working through more than 6,000 tips they have received over the course of the investigation so far. “We have quality information that we’re working on,” said Snell.On Wednesday, police began the process of returning some of the victims’ belongings to their families. “It’s time for us to give those things back that really mean something to those families and hopefully to help with some of their healing,” Moscow Police Chief James Fry said Tuesday in a brief video statement.“I’m a dad, I understand the meaning behind some of those things,” Fry said.They were  amazing people and were loved so much : Here s what we know about the University of Idaho victimsThe items removed from the house where the four students were killed are “no longer needed for the investigation,” police said.As they work to figure who killed the students, police have built a timeline of what they were doing in the hours leading up to their deaths and what happened before police were called.All four had been out enjoying a typical weekend night – two were at a bar in downtown Moscow while the other two were at a fraternity house, investigators have said. They all returned to the home by 2 a.m.Later in the morning, two surviving roommates “summoned friends to the residence because they believed one of the second floor victims had passed out and was not waking up,” police said in a release. Just before noon, a person called 911 from the house using one of the surviving roommates’ phones. Two of the victims were found by responding officers on the second floor and two others were on the third floor. There were no signs of sexual assault, police said. Authorities also did not see signs of forced entry or damage. Detectives do not believe the surviving roommates were involved in the killings, police have said.CNN’s Taylor Romine, Veronica Miracle and Stella Chan contributed to this report.

 A group of former Twitter employees who are suing the company spoke out Thursday, alleging that new owner Elon Musk’s mass layoffs at the company have triggered multiple labor rights violations. “Real people were affected by this, I have a family, I have kids to support,” former Twitter engineer Wren Turkal said during a press conference in San Francisco. “All that we’re looking for is fairness.” Another former Twitter engineer, Emmanuel Cornet, said during the event: “It seems like the layoffs have been done in a way that’s really clumsy and inhumane and potentially illegal … and this is the aftermath.”Twitter, which recently laid off much of its communications department, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuits or former employee comments.The employees who spoke during the Thursday press conference are each plaintiffs in lawsuits filed by attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan against Twitter on behalf of former employees who were affected by Musk’s takeover of the company. The four suits, all of which are seeking class action status, include claims that Twitter reneged on promises to allow remote work and consistent severance benefits after the Musk acquisition, as well as complaints related to alleged disability and gender-based discrimination, and another suit on behalf of Twitter contractors who were laid off.Layoffs, ultimatums, and an ongoing saga over blue check marks: Elon Musk s first month at TwitterThe press conference was held ahead of the first hearing in the initial case, in which a group of five former employees allege that Musk has violated promises the company made to employees prior to his takeover.The suit alleges that employees were assured they could continue to work remotely for at least a year following the acquisition and were promised that any workers laid off under Musk would receive the same benefits and severance that employees had been entitled to prior to the takeover.The lawsuit also claims that in the case of at least one employee terminated as part of the mass layoffs on November 1, Twitter did not provide sufficient notice required by federal and California laws, nor was he offered additional pay in lieu of the notice.The attorney said Thursday she has also filed three claims against Twitter with the National Labor Relations Board on behalf of former employees.The lawsuits were filed after Musk laid off around half of Twitter’s staff last month, in an effort to slash costs following his $44 billion acquisition of the social media company. The company hadn’t previously filed notice to state or local officials of the layoff plans, immediately raising questions about whether the terminations might violate California and federal WARN Acts, although at least some employees reportedly received sufficient pay to negate the need for such notice. During Thursday’s hearing, lawyers for the former employees were set to ask a federal court for an order barring Twitter from seeking separation agreements with laid off employees without informing them of the lawsuit and their associated rights. As part of the requested order, they are also seeking to bar Twitter from communicating with employees in any way that could undermine their rights as part of the litigation.“Plaintiffs are very concerned that employees will be asked to sign away their rights without notice that they have legal claims to additional benefits and severance and that these legal claims have already been filed on their behalf,” the former employees said in their lawsuit. Liss-Riordan added during the press conference that, “the richest man in the world is not above the law. The employees have rights here.” Weeks after the initial Twitter layoffs, hundreds more Twitter employees exited after Musk gave them an ultimatum to work “extremely hardcore” or leave the company.“Of all the issues Elon Musk is facing right now, this feels like the easiest one to fix … treat your workers with respect,” Liss-Riordan said.Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

 The Defense Department has named Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Oracle as the winners of a multibillion-dollar cloud computing contract whose predecessor the Pentagon had to cancel amid Amazon’s allegations that then-President Donald Trump had interfered in the award process.The contracts announced Wednesday evening for the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) call for providing the military with “globally available cloud services across all security domains and classification levels, from the strategic level to the tactical edge,” through mid-2028.The multiple winners are eligible to receive a combined total of up to $9 billion under the program. Each of the four tech companies is guaranteed at least $100,000 under the contract, defense officials said at a press briefing Thursday. The use of multiple tech firms for the cloud services instead of just one will make the work cheaper and more resilient, the officials added.The new contract will allow US military personnel across the globe to access top-secret information in the cloud, said John Sherman, the Pentagon’s chief information officer. That means US military officers in remote places — aboard a ship in the Pacific, for example — will have better access to sensitive data when they need it most, Sherman told reporters. The massive IT contract will help the US military as it looks for a technological edge on potential adversaries, he said.“Leveraging US companies that are world leaders on this is what we absolutely have to have to be able to stay ahead of these pacing challenges,” Sherman told reporters. “This puts us where we need to be as a Department of Defense and protecting what we need to protect.”The Pentagon’s multi-vendor approach diverges from its prior cloud contracting effort, the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI), which focused on procuring a single cloud vendor for the entire military.The JEDI contract was initially awarded to Microsoft in 2019, a deal potentially worth up to $10 billion over 10 years. But it quickly became bogged down in a legal battle after Amazon alleged Trump “launched repeated public and behind-the-scenes attacks” against the company in an effort to undermine its contracting bid and to hurt then-CEO Jeff Bezos, “his perceived political enemy,” because of his ownership of The Washington Post.In 2020, the Pentagon said it wanted to re-evaluate its decision to award Microsoft the deal. And it formally canceled the JEDI contract last year, starting over with a new solicitation under the JWCC.“We are honored to have been selected for the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability contract and look forward to continuing our support for the Department of Defense,” a spokesperson for Amazon Web Services said in a statement Thursday. “From the enterprise to the tactical edge, we are ready to deliver industry-leading cloud services to enable the DoD to achieve its critical mission.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

 There’s more concrete evidence that the Covid-19 pandemic set American kids back.Nationwide testing of a representative sample of fourth and eighth graders showed almost across-the-board declines in reading and math.CNN’s Ray Sanchez wrote an in-depth report on the latest results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, known as “The Nation’s Report Card,” which follows similarly alarming results for 9-year-olds released in September.The tests of students’ math and reading were conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics between January and March, the first such assessment in three years, and they showed the largest decline in math scores since the tests were first administered in 1990. No state or large urban district showed improvements in math.Racial and socioeconomic divides in US education are growing, which suggests the pandemic made the country more unequal. From Sanchez’s report:“What we’re seeing is (lower performing) students … dropping even faster and we’re also seeing students who were not showing declines – students at the top, meaning students at the higher performing levels – they were holding steady before the pandemic or even improving,” (NCES Commissioner Peggy) Carr said. “Now all the students, regardless of their ability, are dropping. That is the point we need to be taking away from this report.”There was one thing I was surprised the Nation’s Report Card did not show.“There’s nothing in this data that tells us that there is a measurable difference in the performance between states and districts based solely on how long schools were closed,” Carr said, per Sanchez’s report.People who cover this stuff – here I’m referring to the nonprofit education news organization Chalkbeat – pointed out NCES did not release data to double check that statement.Anecdotally, it’s true that drops in states where students went back to in-person classes earlier, like Florida, were not substantially less than states like California, where more students were out longer.Chalkbeat did its own analysis of the report card data and argued there was some small correlation between school closures and test scores in fourth grade math and, to a lesser degree, in eighth grade math and fourth grade reading. It found no correlation for eighth grade reading. That confounds what many parents might have expected and also previous reports on the deleterious effects of remote schooling. It also complicates the ongoing political argument over schools, funding and safety.It should be a wake-up call that pandemic did not cause the problems in the US education system, but rather exacerbated them, according to Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, who appeared on CNN’s “New Day” on Monday.School districts got big injections of federal money as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, and Cardona said they should use that money to address this specific problem. Plus, the government should continue to spend more on education. “I’m calling on all leaders throughout the country to look at this as a call to action, to invest in education so that we don’t go backwards,” Cardona said. Former Education Secretary Arne Duncan told CNN’s Bianna Golodryga there should be a massive mobilization to catch kids up.“We need a yearlong sprint between this fall and next fall, coming back to school on an individual basis, child by child, to do everything we can to help them catch up,” Duncan said.CNN’s Brianna Keilar pushed Cardona about what the government can do to address a growing shortage of qualified teachers, particularly in rural districts and those with lower-income students.“The symptom of teacher shortage is a symptom of a lack of respect for the profession,” he said.CNN has previously reported on the lack of qualified teachers in certain districts. CNN’s Gabe Cohen talked to Stacy Brady, a biology teacher at Casa Grande Union High School in Arizona, where classes can have more than 70 students or may be taught by paraprofessionals rather than certified teachers.Brady said if she was in a class without a teacher, she’d be hard pressed to learn without someone who could explain the subject to her.“If there’s nobody who has the content knowledge to do that, I’m gonna shut down,” Brady said. “And I’m thinking many of our students might be shutting down as well.”In his TV segment, Cohen also featured an eighth grade teacher and mother from Long Island, Michelle Burke, who said there is a lot of pressure on children, which comes out in class.“A lot of the things that we are seeing emotionally, behaviorally, are putting a huge strain on what you’re seeing in the classroom,” Burke said in Cohen’s report.While the problems are larger than the pandemic and predate school closures, this report card is part of the price Americans paid for the virus, according to Dr. Paul Offit, professor of pediatrics and the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.Offit appeared on CNN to talk about the rise in cases of the respiratory ailment RSV that is crowding children’s hospitals, but he also weighed in on the report card and pointed out that while children can get very sick from Covid-19, they are far less likely to suffer hospitalization or death than older people. “I’d like to think we can be smarter about how to move forward with this so the cure isn’t worth the disease,” he said of the possibility of a future pandemic. “Because we paid an enormous price, and nobody paid a bigger price I think than kids.” © 2023 Cable News Network.

 Amazon(AMZN) stock fell some 14% in after-hours trading Thursday after the company forecast its holiday quarter sales would be lighter than analysts had expected. The e-commerce giant said it expects revenue for the final three months of the year to be between $140 billion to $148 billion, significantly below the $155 billion analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had expected. The weaker forecast comes as rising inflation and looming recession fears weigh on consumer purchasing decisions. Amazon reported revenue of $127.1 billion for its third-quarter, a 15% increase from the prior year but just missing Wall Street estimates. “There is obviously a lot happening in the macroeconomic environment, and we’ll balance our investments to be more streamlined without compromising our key long-term, strategic bets,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement accompanying the earnings release.Big Tech can t save your investmentsThe company reported its Amazon Web Services segment sales increased 27% year-over-year to $20.5 billion – representing a slower pace of growth for a closely-watched business unit than Wall Street had expected. But Amazon’s cloud computing division continues to be a strong profit driver for the company. Amazon posted a $2.9 billion profit for the three-month period, much improved from the prior quarter when it posted $2 billion net loss largely due to its investment in electric vehicle maker Rivian. The latest results comes at a precarious time for the e-commerce giant. Amazon initially saw its business boom during the pandemic, as more consumers relied on online shopping. This year, however, the company is confronting a shift back to in-person shopping as well as a souring economic outlook has hampered consumers’ demand. Jesse Cohen, a senior analyst at Investing.com, said Amazon’s earnings report “proves it’s not immune to the challenges facing the tech industry at large as it struggles in the face of worsening macroeconomic headwinds, such as soaring inflation and worries about a possible recession.”

24,,"The backlash against one moment in Taylor Swift’s “Anti-Hero” music video appears to have prompted the release of an updated version.Eagle-eyed Swift devotees noted on Wednesday that the Apple Music version of the Grammy-winner’s video, from her tenth studio album “Midnights,” no longer includes a controversial moment that showed the word “fat” on a scale. By Thursday morning, the YouTube version of the video had also been replaced.The video, which was written and directed by the singer, is meant to portray Swift’s “nightmare scenarios and intrusive thoughts,” according to her Instagram.The scene that angered some viewers shows Swift in the bathroom weighing herself on a scale as her inner critic (also played by Swift) looks on. A closeup of the scale reveals the word “FAT” instead of showing a number, and crestfallen Swift looks down as the other Swift shakes her head, disappointed. The new version of the video no longer cuts to the word, a moment some body positivity advocates construed as fatphobic.CNN has reached out to Apple as well as representatives for Swift for comment.6 things Taylor Swift has taught me about living wellSwift has previously made references to her past battles with disordered eating and body image struggles.In her 2020 documentary “Miss Americana,” Swift said unflattering pictures and unkind comments about her figure would sometimes “trigger me to just starve a little bit – just stop eating.”The debate over the video even made it onto “The View,” where co-host Sunny Hostin said critics “missed the point.”Regardless, the controversy has seemingly had little effect on the album’s popularity. Swift’s new album, which was released on October 21, has sold more than 1.2 million album units in the US during its first three days of release, according to Billboard, citing the music data firm Luminate. The initial sales figures include any pre-orders.Swift has also become Spotify’s most-streamed artist in a 24-hour period thanks to “Midnights.” This story has been updated to reflect that the YouTube version of Swift’s video has also been replaced with a new version. © 2023 Cable News Network.

25,,"President Joe Biden’s visit Thursday to Syracuse in deep-blue New York might seem like an unusual one for him to make less than two weeks before the midterm elections. But his unpopularity and Democrats’ struggles nationally have funneled down to a state he won by 23 points in 2020. This has put Republicans in a surprisingly strong position in New York. I’m not just talking about the gubernatorial race, where Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul is in a close contest with Republican Lee Zeldin. I’m talking about the fact that Republicans could win enough seats to take back the US House majority from New York alone. The Cook Political Report, for example, lists five Democratic-held House seats as competitive (i.e., leaning toward one party or a toss-up). The Republicans, of course, need a net gain of five seats to win control of the chamber. No seat may be more illustrative of Democrats’ problems in New York than the 17th Congressional District. It’s in the Lower Hudson Valley but within the New York City metropolitan area. Biden would have won the district under its current lines by 10 points in 2020. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, who leads House Democrats’ campaign arm, decided to run for this seat instead of the more Republican 18th District after redistricting. In doing so, he essentially forced Democratic Rep. Mondaire Jones to abandon the district, a version of which he currently represents. In other words, Maloney chose this district because he thought he’d have an easier time winning it. But the political trends over the past month in the 17th District have favored his Republican opponent, state Assemblyman Mike Lawler. An average of Cook Political Report and Inside Elections data shows that what started as a race likely to be won by Maloney became 15 days ago a race only leaning toward him and has now turned into something akin to a toss-up contest.Maloney’s problems make sense when you consider what’s going on nationally and statewide. Republicans have been gaining ground on the generic congressional ballot, which usually asks respondents some form of the following question: “If the elections for Congress were held today, would you vote for the Democratic or Republican party?” What was a slight Democratic advantage on this measure last month is now tilting toward the Republicans. And voters statewide (including in the New York City suburbs) are more worried about crime and inflation – issues that favor Republicans – than others. Democrats’ difficulties also fit with what we’ve seen historically. Although New York is normally thought of as a blue state, it tends to swing with the nation in waves. In 2006, Democrats netted 3 House seats in New York on their way to reclaiming the chamber majority. In 2010, Republicans netted 6 House seats in the Empire State on their way to a majority nationally. In 2018, Democrats took back the House in part because they netted 3 seats in New York. The bottom line is that if there is a Republican wave nationally in 2022 – which seems to be a strong possibility – we’ll likely see it in New York. © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

He now writes regularly for the Georgia Recorder. Follow him on Twitter at @jaysbookman. The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. 
 Voters continue to turn out in record numbers here in Georgia, with early voting totals approaching those of a presidential election year. In a closely watched, high-stakes, bitterly fought campaign season like this one, the question is natural: What does it mean?In terms of predicting outcomes, it’s hard to say. In the Trump era, high turnout is not necessarily the advantage that it used to be for Democrats, and we don’t know how much of the early-voter surge represents newly motivated voters or are merely voters who would have cast their ballots anyway through some other means. High-profile candidates in the Senate and governor’s races are no doubt driving voters to the polls, and with so many wild-card factors in play this year – from the overturning of Roe v. Wade to inflation to changes in state election law – it’s impossible to know what the 2022 electorate is going to look like.That uncertainty is a nightmare for pollsters. Predicting how people will vote is pretty easy. Predicting whether they’ll vote is where things get complicated – and results get misleading. In a tumultuous year like this one, with so many variables, that’s a caution to the rest of us about putting too much credence in pollsters’ work product.Georgia Republicans, however, are ready to claim victory on at least one front. They believe the high turnout represents vindication, proving that SB 202 – the “Election Integrity Act” that they passed last year – wasn’t an effort to suppress voter turnout, as Democrats had claimed. But that boast about Georgia’s 98-page voting bill doesn’t hold up, for several reasons: That last point is critical. To their base, Republicans have said the changes implemented in SB 202 – making absentee balloting more difficult, significantly reducing the number of drop boxes in urban areas – were necessary to fight voter fraud. But logically, that motive makes no sense.Opinion: Heartbreaking Fetterman-Oz faceoffGov. Brian Kemp, who signed the bill into law, and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who advocated for it, had already conceded that voter fraud played no role in recent election outcomes. In Raffensperger’s words, “we had safe, secure, honest elections,” a conclusion shared by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, federal officials in former President Donald Trump’s Department of Justice, and state and federal judges. And if fraud wasn’t the real reason for those changes, what was?From the beginning, the entire “voting fraud” industry has been a bad-faith invention by the right to serve as cover for its voter suppression targeting minorities. We know that because every Republican administration in the last quarter of a century has tried desperately to find evidence of such fraud on a scale sufficient to swing elections, and every such investigation has failed abysmally. When he served as Georgia secretary of state from 2010 to 2018, Kemp tried and failed to find such fraud. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis continues to try to find it, and so far he, too, continues to come up empty. And it’s the consequences of that bad-faith narrative that ought to worry us. As we witnessed in 2020, Trump took the suspicion and distrust of the electoral system that the GOP had nurtured over decades and he repurposed it to an even more nefarious goal, transforming it from an excuse to suppress voting into an excuse to treat election outcomes as illegitimate altogether.Opinion: The results of Ryan vs. Vance may spell the end of Ohio s legacyTrump is still making that argument to this day, telling supporters at rallies this fall that “I don’t believe we’ll have a fair election again. I don’t believe it.”That purposeful, corrosive cynicism has an impact on the very foundations of democratic self-government because it finds an audience. In SB 202, for example, Georgia Republicans added a clarifying sentence to a section of state law regarding how a voter, or elector, can legally challenge the eligibility of other voters to cast ballots. It now says that “There shall not be a limit on the number of persons whose qualifications such elector may challenge.” The new law also requires local election boards to hold a hearing on such challenges within 10 business days.If that sounds like an invitation to wreak chaos, it is exactly that.Around the state, conservatives are attempting to challenge the eligibility of tens of thousands of legally registered voters on extremely flimsy grounds and are growing frustrated that those challenges keep failing. In suburban Gwinnett County, for example, “voting integrity” activists have challenged the eligibility of more than 40,000 registered voters in the increasingly diverse, increasingly Democratic county, putting an incredible burden on the county’s small elections staff. The challenges that have been acted upon so far have been rejected in a 3-2, party-line vote, with two Democrats and an independent outvoting Republicans.“We are doing your job,” one frustrated activist told the Gwinnett elections board at its October 19 meeting. “Get your county in order or get your things in order.”That’s what happens when you sell people on a false narrative, then rewrite state law to encourage taking action on that false narrative. If voting isn’t being suppressed so far, confidence in voting surely has been. © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

 Herb Kohler, Jr., the former head of his family’s namesake global plumbing empire, died Saturday at the age of 83. He was the third generation Kohler to helm the Wisconsin company, serving as CEO for 43 years and later as its executive chairman. The emphasis of the Kohler brand during his tenure was design. Kohler accelerated the company’s strategy of bringing the cyclical design fads, wide color choices and luxury add-ons of the auto industry to what had been a humdrum household fixtures market. According to the company, Kohler was generating $6 billion in annual revenue the year Herb Kohler stepped down in 2015, up from $133 million when he began. Last year, it reported $8 billion in revenue.During his tenure, Kohler acquired several firms and rivals: Baker furniture, McGuire Furniture and Sterling Faucet, along with motor and generator manufacturers. But he was best-known for the “Bold Look of Kohler” campaign, which brought avocado green and harvest gold appliances to the kitchen, and later introduced entirely voice-activated bathrooms.In 1981, he also created the American Club Resort, located in Kohler, Wisconsin, a five-diamond, five-star resort as a way to expand into the hotel business. It was built on the location of what had been housing for the company’s workers in the early 20th century.Kohler himself was known for trying out the company’s whirlpools, taste-testing Kohler candy and creating and playing on all of the golf courses, even importing a strain of black sheep common to Ireland to make one course seem more authentic.A passionate golfer, Kohler built four courses in Wisconsin and eventually brought the Ryder Cup to its Whistling Straits course in Sheboygan in 2021. Kohler was founded in 1873 by Herb Kohler’s grandfather, John Michael Kohler, an Austrian immigrant, along with Charles Silberzahn, who later sold his minority share. It remains privately held and family owned.Most stock quote data provided by BATS. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

28,,"During an appearance on Fox News earlier this week, Dr. Mehmet Oz was asked a simple question: If he was elected to the US Senate from Pennsylvania and Republicans take the majority this fall, would he support Mitch McConnell for leader? “I look forward to being in the United States Senate and [am] happy to make that decision for the next leader of the United States Senate … it will be Republican,” said Oz, not answering the question. Pressed for an answer, Oz refused to give one.Which is interesting! Because Oz is far from alone in his unwillingness among Republican Senate aspirants to express fealty for McConnell if the GOP winds up winning control of the Senate in the midterm elections. “When I defeat Murkowski and become Alaska’s next U.S. senator, I will not support Mitch McConnell as leader. It’s time for new, America First leadership in the Senate,” Kelly Tshibaka, a Republican who is among the candidates taking on GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, said last year. Arizona Republican Senate nominee Blake Masters said in a debate earlier this year that McConnell is “not bad at everything. He’s good at judges. He’s good at blocking Democrats. You know what he’s not good at? Legislating.”Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, who is the GOP nominee for the state’s open Senate seat, said of McConnell this past summer: “Mitch McConnell hasn’t endorsed me and I don’t endorse him for leadership.”And Ohio GOP Senate nominee J.D. Vance has previously said McConnell is “a little out of touch with the base” and that there is a need for “new blood” in the ranks of Republican leadership.All of which raises an important question: If Republicans do win the Senate majority, will McConnell have the votes to be elected to lead them?Which is, yes, a bit of putting the cart in front of the horse. At the moment, the fight for Senate control is widely regarded as a toss-up, with Democrats seen as having the edge in money and candidate quality. And if the likes of Oz, Masters and Vance don’t make it to the Senate, then it doesn’t much matter whether they would have voted for McConnell as leader or not.But if these candidates do wind up winning, then they will be forced to confront their past statements in regards to McConnell. And, of course, there’s Donald Trump. The former President has made no secret of his dislike of McConnell and has openly campaigned for some other Republican to take him on as leader. But so far, there have been no takers.Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who runs the Senate GOP campaign committee, has repeatedly butted heads with McConnell – first over his decision to release a policy plan outlining what Republicans would do if they won the majority and, more recently, over McConnell’s comments that “candidate quality” are hindering the party’s chances. In an op-ed published in the Washington Examiner last week, Scott seemed to be speaking directly to McConnell. “Unfortunately, many of the very people responsible for losing the Senate last cycle are now trying to stop us from winning the majority this time by trash-talking our Republican candidates,” wrote Scott. “It’s an amazing act of cowardice, and ultimately, it’s treasonous to the conservative cause.”My strong sense is that for all of the talk about their differences with McConnell, the likes of Oz, Masters and Vance would find a way to vote for him as majority leader if they were confronted with the opportunity in early 2023. Why? For two main reasons:1) A fair amount of what they were (and are) doing is political posturing. Trump doesn’t like McConnell. So, especially during their primaries, these candidates had to keep the MAGA crowd happy – and wavering on support for McConnell was a way to do that. Now that they are party nominees, you are already seeing some slinking back to McConnell.2) It’s not clear they would have any other options. Scott seems far more focused on running for president than he does on running for leader of the Senate Republicans. And the other Senate Republicans who have a constituency in the conference – like, say, John Thune of South Dakota – are not going to challenge McConnell.So, in the end, this is all likely just political posturing. But McConnell, ever the deliberate and careful political tactician, is likely not taking any chances. © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

I saw the pictures on a website called TMZ. I saw you rubbing his disgusting hairy stomach. I knew you were lying about Colton.’ [I had told her I was with a friend, Colton]. Add that to a list of things you are: liar, conniving, evil. You look pudgier too. It’s clear you are eating your guilt.”Her mother went on to write that McCurdy was an “ugly monster” and ended the email by asking her to send money for a new refrigerator.Undergoing therapy helped her realize her mother was abusive, McCurdy said, and she stopped living in “the necessary delusion of my childhood.”“Just because I was abused doesn’t mean I don’t love her,” McCurdy said. “That has been so difficult to grapple with.”© 2023 Cable News Network.

30,,"Every year, September 7 in Brazil is a day of colorful parades, military demonstrations and national pride, as the country celebrates gaining its independence from colonial Portugal. But as Brazil heads toward presidential elections next month, President Jair Bolsonaro appears to be twisting the national holiday toward partisan ends.Along with first lady Michelle Bolsonaro, the president attended a military parade in the capital Brasilia on Wednesday morning, greeting large crowds of supporters as the pair rode in a vintage Rolls-Royce convertible before the beginning of the event.“The Brazilian people today are taking to the streets to celebrate 200 years of independence and eternity freedom. What is at stake is our freedom and our future. The population knows that it is the one that guides our decisions,” Bolsonaro said in an interview with a Brazilian state television channel ahead of the parade.Though Independence Day is supposed to be a nonpartisan national holiday, the president has often referred to it as a key milestone in his re-election campaign, telling supporters to prepare to “give their lives” on that day – an escalation in rhetoric even for the outspoken populist leader.“I call on all of you, on September 7, to take to the streets for the last time … All of you here have sworn to give your life for your freedom. Repeat with me: I swear to give my life for freedom,” Bolsonaro said, as he accepted the Liberal Party’s presidential nomination on July 23.More recently, Bolsonaro told fans to show up to Independence Day celebrations in Rio, where he will be speaking, to “make a stand” and “fight for your freedom” – vague injunctions that critics warn could be interpreted as incitement to unruly behavior. “(September 7) is the time to fight for your freedom.. let’s go make a stand,” the president told viewers during the live address on social media Thursday.“If someone is accused of an undemocratic act, I want to pay myself for their (legal) defense,” he added, using the same term for attacks on Brazilian institutions and democratic norms of which he himself has often been accused.Bolsonaro’s campaign team organized hundreds of political rallies to coincide with Independence Day and the president was expected to give a speech later on Wednesday at a political rally in Brasilia, and then join a military celebration and a rally in Rio de Janeiro in the afternoon. Bolsonaro supporter Paulo Roseno, a former military sergeant who is helping to organize one such rally in Sao Paulo, told CNN he is expecting millions of people to be gathered on the city’s Paulista Avenue in support of Bolsonaro’s candidacy. The president’s calls to action have been widely interpreted as echoing the election-denying rhetoric of former US President Donald Trump, whose convocation of supporters in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, preceded a riot on Capitol Hill. “Bolsonaro and Trump share the same authoritarian populist playbook,” says Guilherme Casarões, professor of political science at Getulio Vargas University and coordinator of Brazil’s Far Right Observatory.“Both indicated they would refuse to accept an electoral result negative to them, both talk about fraud in the ballots. They both also keep a permanent incitement of their radicalized base.”He told CNN that that he foresees a “real risk” of a Jan. 6-type event in Brazil if Bolsonaro’s leftwing rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, eventually claims victory at the polls.“I don’t think we’re going to have a coup in the classic sense with the military on the street, like what happened in 1964,” he said, referring to the historic overthrow that led to two decades of military dictatorship in Brazil. “What I think is more likely to happen is an attempted coup, some kind of subversion of democracy … or any attempt to delay the electoral process by introducing doubts about the legitimacy of the process.” CNN has reached out to Bolsonaro’s office for comment.Waldir Ferraz, a close friend of Bolsonaro who is also organizing the president’s motorcade through Rio, downplays the possibility that the president’s statements could incite unrest or produce chaos.The Independence Day festivities in Rio will simply demonstrate the breadth of Bolsonaro’s support, he told CNN, with “a sea of green and yellow.”But he admits that this show of support is in part motivated by fans’ anger at an electoral system that they have been led to believe is tainted – despite the lack of evidence.“There will be more than 1 million on the streets in Rio, because people now are angry with [Supreme Electoral Court chief] Alexandre de Moraes,” Ferraz says.De Moraes, a longtime thorn in Bolsonaro’s side, this month greenlit search and seizure operations against several businessmen accused of participating in WhatsApp text conversations advocating a coup if Bolsonaro loses the presidential election, CNN Brasil reported.As the race heats up between Bolsonaro and Lula, the incumbent president has frequently made statements undermining the legitimacy of the electoral process among his fans – in what critics fear could set the stage for unrest if Bolsonaro doesn’t win re-election.The president has called for some voters to be filmed at the ballot box (an idea squashed by the Electoral Court) and claimed that the country’s electronic voting system has been compromised in the past and is at risk of fraud now, though there is no record of fraud in Brazilian electronic ballots since they began in 1996. He has also suggested that the Armed Forces should perform a parallel ballot count to verify the result.The military has previously served as observers during elections, along with representatives of political parties and universities. But as Lula pulls ahead in the polls, discussion among supporters of an even more active role by the Brazilian Armed Forces – including calls for a military intervention if Bolsonaro loses – has intensified on social media.“We will not trust the results [if Bolsonaro loses] and will demand the president to call the Armed Forces to intervene. But note that this is not a coup, it is a counter coup,” says Roseno.Against this backdrop, the potential for overlap between military events and pro-Bolsonaro campaign events on Independence Day could offer cause for concern. If the president turns his speech in Rio into a campaign opportunity, the military’s planned display of ships, parachutists and hourly rifle salutes could instantly take on ominous political significance.“We should not have such overlap of a national event with a large military participation with a campaign event,” said Casarões. “The military that should be a state force that serves the interests of a government. [The Independence Day events] will allow Bolsonaro to use the military’s symbol … to lend credibility to his presidential candidacy,” he added.Concerned about the possible politicization of Wednesday’s military maneuvers, the Federal Attorney’s office of Rio sent an official letter to the local Military, Naval and Air command publicized on Sept. 2 asking how it would ensure that official Independence Day celebrations would not be confused with partisan political demonstrations.Asked if it had received a response, the Attorney’s office told CNN that the Armed Forces has until Wednesday morning to reply. The military did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.Ever since Bolsonaro’s decree last year allowing active-duty military to hold public office , the border between his government and Brazil’s military leadership has been increasingly blurred.The president, himself a former Army captain, has made no secret of his admiration of the Armed Forces. He frequently invokes the military on the campaign trail and has done little to avoid the appearance of politicizing the country’s military. His vice presidential candidate is an active general, General Walter Braga Netto. In 2020, over 6000 members of his government were members of the military, according to a report published by the Federal Audit Court (TCU).Brazil could face  more severe  election unrest than the US Capitol riot, official warnsThe sympathy appears to run both ways. The Armed Forces’ leadership has echoed Bolsonaro’s election fraud claims, raising its own doubts about voting security to the Electoral Court.Defense Minister Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira last July said the military leadership did not necessarily doubt the electoral system, but said he believed it needed improvement. “We know very well that this electronic system always needs improvement. There is no program immune to an attack, immune to being invaded,” said Nogueira during a hearing at the Commission on Foreign Relations and National Defense.“We are not doubting, or thinking this or that. It is simply a collaborative spirit,” added the minister. Bolsonaro has said that he will accept the results of the upcoming Brazil presidential election “as long they are fair and clean,” in an interview with TV Globo´s Jornal Nacional this month. His campaign and political allies have also dismissed fans’ calls for military intervention. To Ferraz, chatter online and among extremist Bolsonaro supporters of a military intervention in the upcoming election has no basis in reality. “This can’t happen,” he says. Nevertheless, Roseno, the rally organizer, insists that he expects the worst. Falsely convinced that the deck is loaded against his candidate, he predicts that if the Armed Forces don’t intervene to ensure Bolsonaro’s re-election, “the people will” – conjuring exactly the vision of violent insurrection that experts warn the president risks inciting.CNN’s Caitlin Hu in New York contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/07/americas/brazil-independence-day-demonstrations-latam-intl-cmd/index.html

32,,"New British Prime Minister Liz Truss has assembled the most ethnically diverse Cabinet in the United Kingdom’s history, with several top jobs given to Black and other minority ethnic lawmakers.For the first time ever, none of the holders of the country’s four so-called “Great Offices of State” – the prime minister, the chancellor and the home and foreign secretaries – is a White man. Kwasi Kwarteng, who will take charge of the UK’s dire economic situation as chancellor, was born in London after his parents migrated from Ghana in the 1960s; the mother of James Cleverly, the new foreign minister, came to the UK from Sierra Leone, while incoming Home Secretary Suella Braverman has Kenyan and Mauritian parents.No other G7 country can claim such diversity at the heart of government and it reflects a rapid rise in the number of minority ethnic politicians to the top tables of British politics in the past decade. But experts say this fact can obscure other prevalent inequalities in the UK’s political system. Critics fear the continuation of a series of divisive Conservative government policies towards refugees, asylum seekers and disadvantaged communities, and some have pointed to the class and educational backgrounds of the country’s new Cabinet as a symbol of Britain’s most defining political gulf. Liz Truss has a nightmare to-do list. Here are some of the biggest challenges she faces“It’s extremely significant and it’s an extraordinary rate of change,” Sunder Katwala, the director the the British Future think tank that focuses on issues of immigration, integration and national identity, said of the make-up of Truss’s new Cabinet.But “these are more diverse political elites,” he told CNN. “It’s a meritocratic advance for people who have done well in education, law and business. It’s not an advance on social class terms.”“It’s absolutely fantastic that we have a more diverse House of Commons, set of parties and government, in terms of gender and in terms of ethnicity,” said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University and the author of books on the Conservative Party.“But it does hide the fact that we have an ongoing disappearance of working-class people from politics, and that has knock-on effects in terms of policy and turnout.”Britain saw its first Black Cabinet minister as recently as 2002; a decade ago, none of the most illustrious offices of state had been held by non-White politicians.So the diversity in Truss’s top team reflects a sea change in British politics. “There were no Black or Asian Cabinet ministers until we got into this century … it’s a remarkably rapid change in the last 10 years,” Katwala told CNN. “And even though it’s very recent, it’s already established as a new norm.”Braverman is the third consecutive home secretary from an ethnic minority, while Kwarteng is the fourth such chancellor.Much credit for that shift is attributed to David Cameron, the Conservative prime minister from 2010 until 2016, who prioritized modernizing a Tory party that had developed a reputation for being out of touch with a multicultural country. Cameron insisted that women and ethnic minorities be included in shortlists when the party selected local candidates.“Cameron had a crucial impact,” Katwala said. “He decided to make it happen – it was his political project to show that his Conservative Party wanted to be part of modern Britain.”But while the Conservative Party has dramatically diversified during its 12 years in power, its voters have not. The Labour Party has comfortably maintained its historic advantage among non-White voters. Pollster Ipsos MORI estimated that Labour won the votes of 64% of all Black and minority ethnic voters in a 2019 election that was otherwise dire for the opposition party, while just one in five voted for the Conservatives. Experts and commentators say that is because the diversity among senior Tories masks other inequalities, and has not equated to a realignment of the party’s political priorities.“A lot is being made of the (government’s) diverse cabinet. The test of that should be, how many members of Britain’s vulnerable, diverse black, muslim and women minority groups now feel they will be heard?,” Adil Ray, an actor and TV presenter who created BBC sitcom “Citizen Khan” which portrayed the lives of a British Pakistani family in Birmingham, wrote on Twitter Wednesday.The new Cabinet also takes the mantle from a previous government that was frequently criticized by anti-racism campaigners for its approach to racial inequality and to migration.Most Black people in Britain believed the Conservative Party is institutionally racist, a CNN/Savanta ComRes poll found in 2020, while 55% of Black people said they did not trust the government to prevent events similar to the Windrush scandal, which saw Caribbean migrants and their descendents wrongly deported from the UK as part of a “hostile environment” policy. “The Conservatives were generating new baggage with Black voters through the Windrush scandal,” and have also suffered in appealing to Muslim Brits in the wake of allegations of Islamphobia in the party and a bitter campaign for the London mayorality in 2016, Katwala said.Other episodes further exposed a divide between ex-leader Boris Johnson’s government and Black Britons. A group of United Nations human rights experts last year strongly condemned a British government-backed report into institutional racism, which concluded that the UK is not institutionally racist. But studies show the prevalence of racism in the country remains evident; more than two in five Black, brown and minority ethnic workers in the UK say they have faced racism on the job, according to one such study released last week. In terms of future policy, Truss, Braverman and most of the Cabinet have pledged their support to a controversial program – brought in by the hardline previous Home Secretary Priti Patel – that would see some asylum seekers deported to Rwanda.The government insisted the program was aimed at disrupting people-smuggling networks and deterring migrants from making the dangerous sea journey across the Channel to England from France. But advocacy and human rights groups have initiated multiple legal challenges and flights have so far been stopped.The early signals suggest those clashes will continue rather than abate in Truss’s government. But observers say that if the government were to soften its approach towards migration, it would receive support from the public.“There is a softening of attitudes to immigration generally, so there is an opportunity for the government to do something different,” Katwala said. Opinion: Britain in 2022 is feeling a lot like 1979 Nonetheless, even the most ethnically diverse Cabinet in UK history is strikingly similar in its educational and class backgrounds.More than two-thirds of the new Cabinet went to fee-paying private schools, including Braverman, Cleverly and Kwarteng, compared to just 7% of the British population as a whole. “If you look at the Conservative brand, it still is seen for good or for ill as the party of the rich,” Bale said. The past four Conservative prime ministers all attended the University of Oxford; of the last five chancellors, only Sajid Javid did not study at Oxford or Cambridge, the UK’s two most elite universities.“Politics has become a graduate profession; some of the skills required for politicians tend to be associated with people who’ve been to university,” Bale said.That runs the risk of dissuading a generation of people from engaging in elections, he warned. “What we’ve seen over the past couple of decades is the almost complete disappearance of working class MPs in Parliament … around a third of the population don’t really see anybody that sounds and looks like them in Parliament.”CNN’s Christian Edwards contributed reporting.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/07/uk/liz-truss-diverse-cabinet-uk-gbr-intl/index.html

 When a Twitter whistleblower testified at an explosive Senate hearing this week, the social media company wasn’t the only one to come under fire. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle repeatedly criticized federal regulators who for years had supposedly been keeping a close eye on the company. “I’m concerned that for almost 10 years the Federal Trade Commission didn’t know or didn’t take strong enough action to ensure Twitter complied with the consent decree” it signed with the agency in 2011, said Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s top Republican. “Congress should … be mindful of the FTC’s ability, or lack thereof, to successfully oversee these important issues.” Committee chair Dick Durbin also signaled concerns about the FTC when he asked the whistleblower, Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, to grade US regulatory agencies’ performance in light of his Twitter allegations. “Honestly, I think the FTC is a little, you know, over their head,” Zatko replied. An FTC spokesperson declined to comment for this story. Twitter is unable to catch and remove foreign agents in its ranks, whistleblower testifies The sharp, bipartisan remarks from members of Congress and Zatko, Twitter’s (TWTR) head of security from November 2020 until this January, highlight the growing frustration inside and outside Washington about the struggle to hold Silicon Valley accountable after years of scrutiny — even as lawmakers held yet another hearing in an attempt to do just that.In his testimony this week, Zatko alleged Twitter had serious, undisclosed security and privacy vulnerabilities that have put users and national security at risk. But the day also put the spotlight on a federal agency that critics say is both under-resourced to take on billion-dollar tech companies like Twitter, and that pulls its punches when it does. Zatko described how Twitter — which had committed to protecting user data and maintaining a strong information security program under its FTC consent order — allegedly did not take US regulators seriously and actively misled them. “Some of the foreign regulators were much more feared than the FTC,” Zatko said,noting that France’s privacy regulator “terrified Twitter in comparison.” Zatko testified that French officials investigating possible privacy violations demanded concrete, quantitative data from Twitter, often on short deadlines, to back up the company’s claims of compliance, and were known to threaten steep penalties for noncompliance that could directly hinder Twitter’s future growth.“[They took a] ‘maybe you won’t be allowed to monetize in France, or maybe you won’t be allowed to use a particular data source in France,’ you know, and ‘you have a week to respond,’ sort of approach,” Zatko told Sen. Richard Blumenthal. In contrast, Twitter did not fear the FTC, Zatko claimed, because the agency largely allowed the company to “grade their own homework” in compliance audits and tended to issue one-time fines that were viewed within the company as little more than a cost of doing business. In response to Zatko’s allegations, Twitter has accused the whistleblower of painting a “false narrative” of the company that is “riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies.” Twitter has also said Zatko was not involved in efforts to prepare company compliance reports and did not fully comprehend the company’s legal obligations.According to his disclosure to the US government, Zatko’s allegations are informed by statements from his own staff at the company whom he says were “intimately familiar” with Twitter’s FTC obligations. Twitter was not ever in compliance with the 2011 order and was never on track to become compliant, Zatko’s subordinates allegedly told him, according to the disclosure.Zatko’s testimony has prompted unusually outspoken criticism of an agency that is considered America’s chief privacy and data security regulator — and done so at a time when that agency is said to be more focused on reining in the tech industry under Chair Lina Khan, a high-profile skeptic of large tech platforms. The FTC has become increasingly involved in technology oversight in recent decades. In 2011, it hired its first chief technologist, and in 2015, a federal appeals court affirmed the FTC’s authority to prosecute companies for data security lapses — a major victory that helped cement the FTC’s role as a cop on the digital beat. This year, the FTC launched a process that could eventually lead to the creation of sweeping new privacy regulations covering virtually all businesses that handle consumer data, including platforms such as Twitter.Twitter shareholders vote overwhelmingly in favor of Elon Musk s $44 billion takeover dealBut there have been other moments that prompted critics to doubt whether the FTC is up to the task. In 2013, the commission voted unanimously not to sue Google over concerns about the company’s impact on competition, despite a recommendation from agency antitrust staff to do so. And although a privacy settlement with Facebook in 2019 led to a record $5 billion fine and numerous new legal obligations for that company, critics have said the FTC should have insisted on holding CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg personally accountable in the resulting order. As with Facebook, the latest allegations against Twitter could lead to billions of dollars in new FTC fines, former agency officials have told CNN. But some lawmakers expressed disappointment this week with the penalties the FTC has imposed thus far on the company, and raised doubts about regulators’ ability to meaningfully deter future wrongdoing. In May, the FTC reached a $150 million settlement with Twitter to resolve separate allegations it violated its consent order, when Twitter allegedly used account security information for targeted advertising purposes.“The size of the penalty, a mere $150 million, amounts to the kind of burden on us average drivers when we pay the toll to go into Manhattan,” said Blumenthal, a former Connecticut attorney general.Zatko agreed the fine was indeed “much less than we [at Twitter] had been concerned about.” Twitter’s nightmare scenario, he said, was if the FTC “were to come in and tell us we’re not allowed to monetize email addresses because of our continued inability to handle them correctly. Then we might not be on fair footings with our competitors, and that scared [Twitter].” Lawmakers and regulators have also consistently called for more resources that can be devoted to enforcement. While there have been some attempts to expand FTC budgets and hire more in-house experts, former agency officials and consumer advocates have described staff as overwhelmed with work and outmatched by the armies of lawyers tech giants can bring to bear. Twitter has said its FTC compliance record speaks for itself, in the form of third-party audits filed with the agency. But Zatko said during his time at the company, the FTC allowed Twitter to hire its own auditors, who relied heavily on corporate self-assessments — a practice former FTC officials have described as routine and as an important way the agency saves on time and manpower. (The latest settlement, from earlier this year, now prohibits Twitter auditors from relying “primarily” on the company’s own self-reporting.) Zatko alleges that this setup has helped Twitter get away with misleading regulators. In a separate hearing this week, another Twitter executive could not categorically deny, under repeated and direct lawmaker questioning, allegations that the company “has willfully misrepresented facts to the FTC.” That alleged deception, said Blumenthal in Tuesday’s hearing, perhaps along with “inadequate resources or a failure of will,” may explain what he characterized as “a lack of vigor in law enforcement.”He said this issue can only be effectively addressed by “restructuring, reforming and energizing our regulatory apparatus” — potentially by even transferring FTC authority over privacy and security to a whole new government agency. (Blumenthal is not the only senator to float such a proposal: In May, Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet introduced legislation to create a new commission regulating digital platforms.) “Clearly,” Blumenthal said, “what we’re doing right now is not working.”Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

About 61% of respondents in a recent poll said gas will be a major factor in their vacation plans this year.

In Philadelphia, three people died and 11 others were injured over the weekend after gunfire rang out at a popular entertainment district, officials said. Three others were killed and at least 14 were injured in a shooting in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Eight people were shot at a high school graduation party in Summerton, South Carolina, with one person killed. Several other shootings forced various law enforcement entities to remain on alert across the country. This comes as bipartisan talks on gun legislation are ongoing – but previous attempts in Congress to pass major gun regulation measures have either stalled or failed.Ukrainian authorities have found 440 graves at a mass burial site in Izium, an eastern city recently recaptured from Russian forces, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said in a Twitter post today. “We want the world to know what is really happening and what the Russian occupation has led to,” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said, adding that Ukrainian and international journalists will be shown the site to see what had been uncovered. Izium was subject to intense Russian artillery attacks in April and was taken back by Ukrainian forces on Saturday, delivering a strategic blow to Russia’s military assault in the east. Separately, the White House announced a $600 million security package for Ukraine on Thursday, providing its military with another round of assistance during its ongoing counteroffensive against Russia.Russian President Vladimir Putin is warning that Moscow will strike new targets if the US supplies long-range missiles to Ukraine. Delivering new arms to Kyiv would only “drag out the armed conflict for as long as possible,” Putin said yesterday. Meanwhile, Putin claims Russia’s actions in Ukraine “have nothing to do” with the looming global energy and food crisis, and has instead blamed Western economic policies. He also blamed European countries for not listening “to our urgent requests to preserve long-term contracts for the supply [of natural gas]” – another factor that he said led to inflation. In Ukraine, some of the “fiercest battles” are being fought in the eastern city of Severodonetsk, the region’s top official said today, adding that the evacuation of 15,000 civilians remains impossible because of intense fighting.Former President Donald Trump is mobilizing his MAGA allies to defend him ahead of the upcoming public hearings by the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. Trump’s team has asked some prominent Republicans to cover for him and push back on the committee while the public hearings play out, according to GOP sources familiar with the request. Committee members have teased that the prime-time hearings could be focused on Trump’s direct role in undermining the election results. The committee has been working toward a thesis that Trump’s obsession with losing the election and his peddling of false claims about the results is what laid the groundwork for the violent and deadly riot at the Capitol. The first public hearing will take place Thursday at 8 p.m. ET.The baby formula manufacturing plant that has been at the center of the nationwide shortage restarted production Saturday. Abbott, located in Sturgis, Michigan, said in a statement it has started with the production of specialty formulas for babies who can’t tolerate more common ones, with the first batches expected to be available to consumers around June 20. Similac and other products made at the plant will take longer to become available, the company said. The Sturgis plant has been shut down for months following an FDA inspection that found dangerous bacteria – which can be deadly to infants – in several areas at the facility.President Biden to personally meet with Griner and Whelan familiesPresident Biden will meet with the families of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan at the White House today, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN. This is the first time he will meet with them in person. Griner was detained in Russia in February for carrying vape cartridges containing cannabis oil in her luggage. The two-time US Olympic basketball gold medalist pleaded guilty to drug charges and said she accidentally packed the cartridges while in a hurry. She was convicted in August and sentenced to nine years in jail.

36,,"Cristiano Ronaldo scored his first goal of the season as Manchester United defeated Sheriff Tiraspol 2-0 in the Europa League. After Jadon Sancho’s opener, Ronaldo doubled United’s lead in Moldova from the penalty spot in the first half – the 699th goal of his club career. It was an important victory for United following defeat in the Europa League against Real Sociedad last week, and it was a much-needed goal for Ronaldo, who has struggled to earn a place in the starting 11 under manager Erik ten Hag. The 37-year-old was reported to have been looking for a move away from United over the summer, such was his desire to play in the Champions League, and was absent during preseason. “We could expect this when you miss preseason, so he has to work really hard and invest to get the right fitness. Then he will score more goals,” ten Hag said of Ronaldo’s slow start“You can see he is really close (and) when he gets fitter he will finish (his chances). I think (he is) totally committed to this project and totally committed to this team, totally involved.”United took the lead on Thursday with a well-worked move in the 17th minute. After a neat interchange of passes, Christian Eriksen found Sancho, who created space in the area to get a shot past Sheriff goalkeeper Maksym Koval. Sancho almost got a second later in the half, but saw his shot superbly cleared off the line by Stjepan Radeljić. Moments later, however, Diogo Dalot was brought down in the box, allowing Ronaldo to step up and extend United’s lead six minutes before halftime. There were more chances for United in the second half, including for midfielder Bruno Fernandes, but the scoreline remained 2-0. ”We got the job done, and we know it is always difficult to play here,” said ten Hag.“We were really direct, but I also feel like we controlled the game – not from the first minute, but after 10 minutes, we found our foot in the game and managed to create some spaces.”With United’s weekend fixture against Leeds postponed following the Queen’s death, the team’s next game will be against derby rival Manchester City on October 2.© 2023 Cable News Network.

37,,"Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday condemned Republican Rep. Clay Higgins’ treatment of an environmental lawyer during a congressional hearing on the climate crisis.“In the four years that I’ve sat on this committee, I have never seen members of Congress, Republican or Democrat, disrespect a witness in the way that I have seen them disrespect you today,” Ocasio-Cortez told Raya Salter, the executive director and founder of the Energy Justice Law and Policy Center and a member of the New York State Climate Action Council.“For the gentleman from Louisiana and the comfort he felt in yelling at you like that, there’s more than one way to get a point across,” the New York Democrat said, later apologizing to Salter on behalf of the committee.Higgins, a Louisiana Republican, referred to Salter as “good lady” and “boo” at different times during the heated exchange.“I’m not quite sure some of you are connected to reality,” Higgins said before pointing his attention toward Salter. “Ma’am, good lady, please prepare your mind ‘cause I’m gonna’ ask you three questions. I’m going to give you most of my time. I think it’s good that America hears what you have to say.”He then asked Salter what she would do with petrochemical products if she had control of the world. In response, Salter implored Higgins to “search your heart and ask your God, what you are doing to the Black and poor people in Louisiana? That would be my first thing to ask.”At one point, as the pair talked over each other, Higgins told Salter: “I’m trying to give you the floor, boo.”CNN has reached out to Higgins’ office for comment.In a tweet following the hearing, Salter shared a video of the exchange and wrote, “Thanks for the support! I’m unbothered by fossil fuel cronies!!!”Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York also commented on the exchange via Twitter, saying, “Small men resort to demeaning tactics when they don’t have the wherewithal to act decently,” and thanking Salter for her “brilliant testimony and work to rescue us from the climate catastrophe.” © 2023 Cable News Network.

38,,"The daughter of cricket legend Shane Warne has called a TV miniseries which will dramatize his life “beyond disrespectful.”Warne’s sudden death from a suspected heart attack on the Thai island of Koh Samui in March shocked the cricketing world, particularly in Australia where he was regarded as one of the country’s greatest sportsmen. At a press conference on Wednesday, Australia’s Channel 9 confirmed plans for a two-part miniseries called “Warnie” which will document the spinner’s life.Channel 9 called it a “fitting tribute to one of the greatest Australians of all time, the Aussie larrikin who lived and loved large” in what it describes as the “must-see drama event of 2023.”But Brooke Warne, Warne’s eldest daughter, has called the series insensitive.“Do any of you have any respect for Dad? Or his family?” she wrote on an Instagram story. “Who did so much for Channel Nine and now you want to dramatize his life and our families [sic] life 6 months after he passed away? You are beyond disrespectful.”In June, Warne’s long-time manager James Erskine criticized plans for the biopic, calling it a “disgrace.”“He’s only been dead for a couple of months and for them to turn this around and think about doing some sensational thing, well, they should be ashamed of themselves,” Erskine told the Herald Sun.“I will be writing to Peter Costello because he is their chairman and saying, please explain. Why would Nine even go there? It’s a disgrace and I will certainly be making my voice heard.”The announcement from Channel 9 comes a day after what would have been Warne’s 53rd birthday. Brooke took to Instagram to mark the day, saying: “Today will always be Your day.” A post shared by B R O O K E🍿 W A R N E (@brookewarne) Channel Nine sent a statement to CNN saying: “Our Warnie mini-series we know will be a celebration of the life of an extraordinary Australian – a man who lived life large and loved passionately. We have enormous respect for Shane and all his achievements, and our hope is all Australians including Warnie’s family will feel the program honours his legacy and life.”Warne is one of cricket’s greatest players, reinventing the art of leg spin bowling and dominating for Australia for around 15 years.He had 708 Test wickets to his name – the most for an Australian, and the second-most of all time behind only Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka.He was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World on three separate occasions, and one of Wisden’s five cricketers of the 20th century. As a legacy, Warne’s is unrivaled – the sport’s greatest ever leg-spinner.Perhaps his greatest moment came in the 1993 Ashes series against England when he delivered ‘the ball of the century’ to completely bamboozle Mike Gatting. The video of the delivery was shared extensively on social media as news of his death spread.In the wake of his death, tens of thousands of fans gathered at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to say goodbye to “Spin King” Warne at a state memorial service for the cricket great. © 2023 Cable News Network.

39,,"Garnell Whitfield is still suffering the trauma of losing his mother to racist violence at a Buffalo supermarket. Whitfield said the mass shootings that followed and Republican lawmakers’ refusal to support significantly stricter gun laws have made it even harder to cope. He also worries many elected officials and religious institutions have remained silent about the impact of White supremacy.“You go from being sad and missing your loved one to being very angry,” Whitfield said. “It’s a lot to take in to know that other people are going through the same thing. It’s a lot to know that people are sitting in places of authority and basically giving the green light to this nonsense.” Buffalo s Black residents receive warm embrace after mass shooting but worry about what happens  when the hugs stop  On Friday, Tops Friendly Markets reopened the doors of its Buffalo store two months after Whitfield’s 86-year-old mother, Ruth E. Whitfield, and nine others were killed when a White supremacist opened fire there. The supermarket has undergone a complete renovation, with additional safety and security measures in place, as well as the creation of a memorial for the shooting victims inside the store, Tops Friendly Markets said in a news release. New security measures in the supermarket include enhanced video monitoring systems, an emergency evacuation audio/visual alarm system, the installation of additional emergency exits and increased professional security both inside and outside of the store.Community members say that while the Tops store is sorely needed in the neighborhood, many Buffalo residents are still traumatized by the massacre. Family members and survivors are still grieving. Residents are fearful of another attack. And there is still an uneasiness when neighbors see a White person walking through their majority Black neighborhood of Masten Park. Local activists said they don’t expect many people will shop at the store in the first few weeks after it reopens but they hope that apprehension doesn’t last. The east side neighborhood is a food desert and residents fought hard to get a grocery store before Tops opened in 2003. “I think there will be people who don’t want to go there and will never go there again,” said Garnell Whitfield, who is the former Buffalo fire commissioner. “But convenience and necessity take over and that store will be a viable part of that community.”A dedication ceremony for the store’s reopening was held Thursday afternoon and included a community prayer and a moment of silence for the shooting victims. “This is the day where we declare that hate did not win, that hate was defeated, that hate has no place in East Buffalo or Buffalo or in the great state of New York, and that this community … drove out the darkness,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said. “It is a bright day in Buffalo and I want the residents to know that everything is going to be all right.”Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said the outpouring of support for the store’s reopening is “proof positive that love beats hate.”“We will take this place of tragedy and in the days, the weeks, the months, the years to come, it will be a national and worldwide example of a place of triumph,” Brown said. Community activist Liz Bosley said she has talked to a lot of residents, particularly the elderly, who are terrified of going back into the Tops location. Some wish Tops would have demolished the store and rebuilt it so people wouldn’t have to relive the devastation, she said. “There’s definitely fear that it’s going to happen again,” Bosley said. “If they see a White person in the area, their mind starts wandering. People are afraid.”Bosley said residents have been going to a makeshift market that volunteers created after the shooting where free groceries and hot meals are distributed. Others have been taking buses or Uber rides to other areas of the city to grocery shop. Still, Masten Park needs a brick and mortar supermarket, Bosley said.Buffalo shooting victims:  Hero  guard and a teacher who was a  pillar of the community  are among 10 killedBosley is applying for a job at Tops with hopes that residents who see her working there will feel more comfortable shopping at the store, she said. “I want to give people the courage to know that it’s OK to come back and shop at Tops,” Bosley said. Other community leaders are also hoping to persuade residents to shop at the reopened store. Bishop Perry Davis of New Life Harvest World Ministries in Buffalo said he planned to be at Tops on Friday when it reopened to console the community and comfort anyone who shows up. Davis said the reopening of the store will open wounds for many in the neighborhood.“There will be fear of another attack because it’s so fresh, it’s a fresh situation,” Davis said. “We are talking about 10 souls, 10 people that died just a couple months ago, so that’s definitely going to stay in the forefront of everyone’s mind.” But Davis is encouraging the community to show its strength by patronizing Tops, which he says is a necessity for the neighborhood.“We are not going to just bow down and kowtow to fear,” Davis said. Some survivors of the shooting say they have especially struggled with the idea of returning to the store. Tops employee Fragrance Harris Stanfield was working at the store the day the shooting happened but was able to escape. Stanfield told CNN’s Athena Jones that she visited the store on Thursday but still isn’t ready to go back to work.Stanfield said the visit was emotional and her coworkers had to console her. “Everyone was with me walking and some of my really close coworkers were walking with me and just helping me to breathe through it, talking me through it,” Stanfield said. “And then I had to take a step back because I was just overwhelmed and began to cry.” Despite her emotions, Stanfield said she supports the store reopening to the community. “I just don’t want it to be that we are expected to be so resilient that we forget that this happened or so resilient that we are forgotten about, but they should know that they can’t break us,” she said. Tops produce manager Rose Marie Wysocki, who also survived the massacre, said the renovated store was “beautiful” but she had a difficult time walking through the door.“It’s going to take us a long time to get over this. It really is,” Wysocki said. “We’re living, breathing human beings. A lot of us are still having nightmares. A lot of us aren’t sleeping well at night.”Mark Talley, who lost his mother, Geraldine Talley, in the attack, agreed that Buffalo’s east side needs to remain strong and keep Tops open. “I originally didn’t want the store to reopen,” Talley said. “But at the same time I don’t want the city and my community to feel that we should succumb to defeat.” Talley said he is still angry that his mother – whom he described as a kind woman who loved to make banana pudding, red velvet cake and sweet potato pie – was killed by a White supremacist.Biden gives emotional speech after Buffalo shooting:  White supremacy is a poison But Talley said he refuses to let the tragedy keep him down. He channels his grief by helping distribute groceries to residents at the makeshift marketplace. Talley said people have come in droves to receive items each week from the market, proving that it filled a void in the community while Tops was closed. Talley said giving back has helped him cope. “It’s just my form of grieving, just something to help,” Talley said. “Something that will keep me numb from having to think about the incident, trying not to get lost in my thoughts.”CNN’s Athena Jones, Bonney Kapp, Beth English and Tanika Gray contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/15/us/buffalo-tops-store-reopening-community-fears-reaj/index.html
40,,"The Democratic-led House of Representatives on Friday passed a pair of bills aimed at protecting access to abortion at the federal level in the wake of the Supreme Court’s momentous decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.The House took up the bills in an effort to counter the Supreme Court’s reversal of longstanding legal precedent by holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion.  But the bills are on track to run into a wall in the Senate, where there is not enough support for either piece of legislation to overcome the filibuster’s 60-vote threshold.The first bill approved by the House was HR 8296, the Women’s Health Protection Act of 2022, which is sponsored by Democratic Rep. Judy Chu of California. The bill is aimed at preserving access to abortion nationwide at the federal level.Democrats have made the Women’s Health Protection Act a key agenda item and previously successfully passed a version of the bill in the House. The measure passed on Friday with a vote of 219 to 210. Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas crossing over and voting with all of the House Republicans against the measure.The bill has previously been blocked in the Senate, however. In May, a key Senate vote failed with Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a moderate Democrat, joining with Republicans to vote against the measure and stop it from advancing.The bill’s failure to advance in the Senate was expected at the time amid widespread GOP resistance, but the outcome of the vote nevertheless underscored how Democrats remain severely limited in what they can achieve in terms of safeguarding abortion access with only an extremely narrow Senate majority.The other bill House Democrats passed on Friday was HR 8297, the Ensuring Access to Abortion Act of 2022 sponsored by Democratic Rep. Lizzie Fletcher of Texas. The bill passed largely down party lines, with just three crossover votes, including Michigan Republican Rep. Fred Upton and Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who joined Democrats in voting for the bill. The final vote was 223 to 205.The measure is intended to protect the right to travel to seek access to abortion and would prohibit anyone from restricting or hindering an individual’s ability to cross state lines to obtain an abortion in a state where it is legal to do so. A vote to approve the bill in the House comes as the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has led states to implement their own abortion policies. The ruling has already resulted in a patchwork system across the country in which access to the procedure is, for many people, determined largely by whether a state is controlled by Republicans or Democrats.So-called trigger laws – bans designed to take effect with the overturning of Roe v. Wade – are enforceable in some states following the Supreme Court’s ruling, while in others, the bans await official action.This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Friday.CNN’s Devan Cole contributed to this report.

The collection covers more than 700 games dating back to Super Nintendo’s US launch in 1991, when the internet was young and the mighty Mario was just a tiny clump of pixels. Kerry Hays, who goes by “Peebs” on Twitch’s video game streaming platform, started collecting English language manuals in his quest to beat every single US Super Nintendo game created.

The online shrine emits nearly noxious levels of nostalgia, tracing the evolution of some of the video game world’s most iconic characters and stories. As a video game lover, Hays says he did it for the good of the art. “Preservation to me is, everybody has access to this stuff when they want it and where they want it,” Hays told NPR.

It has been a remarkable recovery.Christian Eriksen scores with first touch for Denmark upon return to international football after cardiac arrestThe playmaker was later fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) device, a type of pacemaker intended to prevent fatal cardiac arrests by discharging a jolt to restore regular heart rhythm.Former club Inter Milan terminated his contract – Serie A rules do not permit footballers to play in Italy’s top division with an ICD fitted – but he refused to give up on his ambitions of a return to the beautiful game.The 30-year-old declared in January that his heart was “not an obstacle” and he signed for English Premier League club Brentford later that month.He made his debut for the West London side at the end of February – 259 days after he collapsed – receiving rapturous applause as he came off the substitutes’ bench in a home defeat to Newcastle, before starting in back-to-back victories.At his best, Eriksen is one of the most creative and effective midfielders in the game.United manager Erik Ten-Hag is leading a total overhaul at Old Trafford and fans will hope that characters like Eriksen will overturn years of underperformance.During his seven years at Tottenham, and his brief spell at Brentford, Eriksen made 237 Premier League appearances – scoring 52 goals and making 71 assists.The midfielder has been capped 115 times for Denmark, scoring 38 goals for his country. “Manchester United is a special club, and I cannot wait to get started,” Eriksen said in a statement released Friday. “I have had the privilege of playing at Old Trafford many times but to do it in the red shirt of United will be an amazing feeling.”“I have seen Erik’s work at Ajax and know the level of detail and preparation that he and his staff put into every day. It is clear that he is a fantastic coach,” he added.“Having spoken with him and learned more about his vision and the way he wants the team to play, I am even more excited for the future.

43,,"A version of this story appeared in the July 15 edition of CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain’s royal family. Sign up here.
 As summer reaches its height in the UK and Europe, millions of people are heading off on vacation or taking some time away from work to catch up with friends and relatives.And that includes the royals. July and August are typically quiet months in the royal calendar, as members of the clan take a break from their heavy schedule of public duties.Suddenly, the jetsetting and hectic timetable of public appearances, speeches and royal tours stops – and members go off-grid.But how easy is it for the royal family to truly get away from it all – and what happens on a royal holiday?The most famous vacation destination for the royals is Balmoral Castle in Scotland, where the Queen spends her summers and where numerous family get-togethers have taken place.While at Balmoral, the monarch has been pictured enjoying country walks, riding horses and hosting picnics with her family. “It’s the most beautiful place on earth … and I think Granny is most happy there,” Princess Eugenie said in a 2016 ITV documentary.But royals also look to go further afield. The Queen’s late sister, Princess Margaret, spent long holidays on Mustique, an island in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean.Her connection with the island began in 1960 when she saw it while cruising the Caribbean on the royal yacht, Britannia. Its owner, Colin Tennant, gave her a 10-acre plot as a wedding present, and she later used her island villa as a retreat from the glare of the media and to host parties in the company of celebrities.Many royals have also been partial to a cold weather retreat. Prince Philip took his children Princess Anne and Prince Charles on a skiing trip to Liechtenstein in 1965, and Diana, Princess of Wales regularly treated her boys William and Harry to some adventures on the slopes.And sometimes, romance flourishes during royal getaways. When Prince Harry introduced Meghan Markle as his fiancée in 2017, he told reporters about their romantic trip to Botswana, where they camped under the stars, away from prying eyes.That visit was clearly an important one for the couple. Their time in the country was even represented on Meghan’s engagement ring, which featured a diamond from the southern African nation.Harry’s romantic story is not dissimilar to that of his brother, William, who proposed to Kate Middleton during a getaway at a log cabin in the shadow of Mount Kenya. The couple got engaged while staying at a rustic hideaway near a sprawling animal reserve where rhinos and giraffes roam freely.With so many memories made while privately touring the world, it’s little wonder the royals cherish their holidays as much as the rest of us.Last December, William and Kate released a photo from their family trip to Jordan. We don’t yet know where the royals are heading for their vacations this year, but after a busy period over the Queen’s Jubilee weekend last month, there’s no doubt they’ll enjoy setting up their out-of-office emails.Queen hails vaccine rollout.The Queen has dubbed the UK’s Covid-19 vaccine rollout “amazing,” as she paid tribute to the National Health Service (NHS) by awarding the institution the George Cross, Britain’s highest civilian honor. The monarch welcomed representatives from the state-funded service, including nurse May Parsons, who administered the world’s first non-trial Covid vaccine in late 2020. “You’re still alive?” the monarch joked to Parsons after hearing about her role in medical history.The Queen followed up that engagement with a surprise visit to open a new hospice building in Maidenhead, near Windsor on Friday. “Typical, a phone goes off immediately,” the Queen laughed when a member of the group introducing the monarch got a call during her appearance.Bombshell Prince Andrew interview set for big screen.The story behind a landmark TV interview that destroyed Prince Andrew’s reputation is set to be dramatized in a movie, it was confirmed Thursday. The Duke of York spoke to the BBC’s “Newsnight” program in 2019 about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and his uncomfortable performance was swiftly savaged by British media outlets and the public. Its producer, Sam McAlister, whose book “Scoops” is being adapted into movie form, told CNN “it’s hard to believe, even almost three years later, that this momentous interview ever happened.” During the conversation, Andrew claimed he could not sweat and described Epstein’s sexual abuse as “unbecoming.” “As I sat 15 feet behind Prince Andrew in Buckingham Palace I could not believe what he said on camera,” McAlister said.It’s been a busy week for Britain’s future Queen Consort, who’s preparing to turn 75 on Sunday.Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall has been in the spotlight for days in the run-up to her milestone birthday – she guest-edited a special edition of Country Life magazine last week and attended a birthday lunch hosted by the Oldie magazine in London on Tuesday.“You might not believe it, but I have actually been trying to keep quiet about reaching three-quarters of a century – and, as you see, have failed dismally,” Camilla joked at the event.She has balanced the festivities with a full diary of royal engagements. On Thursday, she visited Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in south London, where she got a big welcome from a four-legged resident and urged Britons to “find a friend for life.”Last week we explored how Camilla’s public role has increased in recent months as she prepares to stand by the side of her husband and the country’s next King, Charles.The fanfare over her 75th only accelerates that shift – while also allowing her to bask in a wave of goodwill.The poet Roger McGough even crafted a special work for the duchess’ birthday, which tells her: “Yours are the days ma’am, with the promise of many more ahead. So carpe diem, but gently, for that way they last longer. And don’t count them, just be grateful.”She seemed to take that advice while delivering her speech to the Oldie get-together, in which she described Prince Philip’s philosophy as “Look up and look out, say less, do more – and get on with the job.”“I know that our minds, if not our bodies, will soon be whizzing round that metaphorical dance floor,” Camilla added.Charles and Camilla met with members at the Tabernacle performing arts center, to celebrate the return of London’s Notting Hill Carnival later this summer. The festival, which is organized by members of the city’s Afro-Caribbean community, is returning in August after three years away due to the pandemic.Correction: An emailed version of this newsletter incorrectly stated when the Duchess of Cornwall visited Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. She went there on Friday.

 Wall Street has a tendency to behave like a moody teen. No matter how many times you tell them to be prepared for something, they act like the world is ending whenever that thing comes around. It’s like:Us: Hey, remember how we told you six months ago (and every day since) that the Fed is going to get more aggressive to fight inflation? Well, that’s happening now. Traders: UGH I HATE YOU JUST TAKE ALL MY STOCKS AND GET OUT OF MY ROOM. Here’s the deal: Wall Street is in one of those ~ moods ~ right now.Stocks fell hard at the opening bell before slowwwwly climbing back up. The Dow and S&P 500 still finished down for the day, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was flat.There were two major forces dragging markets down: Bottom line: At the heart of all of this anxiety is fears of a recession. No one likes the R-word. But, as we’ve written many times here, not all recessions are created equal, and many analysts say that if/when the recession hits, it won’t be the kind of catastrophic downturn like the ones we saw in the spring of 2020 or the late 2000s. RELATED: American public pension funds are facing serious challenges that threaten the retirement plans for millions of US state and local government employees In the immortal words of LCD Soundsystem: New York, I love you, but you’re bringing me down. Manhattan rents are historically, notoriously ridiculous — this town is home to an entire political party called Rent Is Too Damn High — but the average monthly cost of an apartment just passed a stomach-churning milestone: $5,000. That’s the average, of course, but the median cost, which is over $4,000 a month, ain’t much easier to swallow. Both figures are up more than 25% from a year ago. The reason for the surge has to do with mortgage rates, which have shot up above 5% in recent months, putting off would-be buyers who are flush with cash and need a place to call home while they wait for a better financing option. The summer air travel debacle has spilled over into absurd territory. Earlier this week, London’s Heathrow took the highly unusual step of telling airlines they need to straight-up stop selling tickets for departing passengers for the rest of the summer. Which we thought was pretty ridiculous. Then CNN Business’ Chris Isidore wrote about how one airline is dealing with one aspect of the Heathrow staffing crisis. Basically, Heathrow doesn’t have enough baggage handlers, and that is a huge problem for an international hub of its size. Massive backlogs of luggage are reportedly piling up at baggage claim. The airport said ground handling teams are staffed at 70% of pre-pandemic levels, my colleague Anna Cooban writes. The problem got so bad, that Delta decided to take what it called a “creative” step of flying a passenger jet, sans passengers, to transfer about 1,000 lost bags, from London to Detroit. Elsewhere inside Heathrow, passengers are finding themselves in human traffic jams as they scramble to get to their gates or jostle for airline help after their flights are canceled or delayed. Just the thing you want to kick off your first vacation in two years…Not helping matters, the airlines and airport are engaged in a little blame game about who should have done what to avoid this mess. Emirates lashed out at Heathrow’s leadership in a statement, calling the situation at the airport an “airmageddon” (which, as far as puns go, isn’t the worst, but it might be a little over the top). “Due to their incompetence and non-action, they are pushing the entire burden — of costs and the scramble to sort the mess — to airlines and travelers,” Emirates said. To that, Heathrow fired back: “For months we have asked airlines to help come up with a plan to solve their resourcing challenges, but no clear plans were forthcoming and with each passing day the problem got worse,” a spokesperson told Anna.Bottom line: The blame game means nothing for the people who’re scrambling to get home, or wherever, and who paid top dollar for flights that were ultimately canceled. At this point I just want someone in Silicon Valley to roll out teleportation so we can be done with airlines and airports for good. Enjoying Nightcap?

 Before the pandemic, many corporate leaders believed that allowing their employees to work from home would hurt productivity. But, in many cases, the pandemic proved otherwise. “Productivity [did not suffer] despite many companies going fully remote. Many thrived through that process and continue to hire at record pace,” said Ben Wigert, director of research and strategy for workplace management at Gallup.Corporate profits, for instance, steadily rose from the second quarter of 2020 through the end of 2021, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The BEA metric takes into account both revenue growth, reflecting productivity, and cost management, reflecting worker efficiency, Wigert noted. Managers have been living in a pressure cooker. Many have had itWhat’s more, when managers were surveyed during the pandemic, “on average, [they] gave a higher performance review score to their remote employees compared to their in-office employees,” said Brian Kropp, chief of research in consulting firm Gartner’s Human Resources Practice. Still, many employers now want workers to return to the office for at least three days a week. Their rationale? The need to strengthen workplace culture, and foster greater collaboration and innovation.While those goals are critical, issuing a mandate that employees work more days in the office than they would like doesn’t ensure success in either arena and could cause some workers to leave, according to workplace experts.Several surveys show that both corporate leaders and workers see true value in returning to the workplace. Humans are social, visceral beings, who often glean more about a situation and build more trust with colleagues in face-to-face exchanges than in virtual ones. And being available in person is essential to mentoring the youngest and newest employees.At the same time, there is also a new acceptance that workers now want flexibility and the option to continue working remotely. In this regard, the question for workers and leaders now is, “When is that extra level of connection [from in-person work] worth the commute, the time, the cost and the angst?,” said Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics. Employers who want workers in the office more often may be in for a fightCurrently, there’s a disconnect between how often employees want to work remotely and how often their companies will let them, according to the latest monthly Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes (SWAA is run by researchers Jose Maria Barrer of the Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico, Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University, Steven J. Davis of the University of Chicago and Jinhua Zhao of the MIT Mobility Initiative).Their data show a majority of organizations (56.1%) are currently offering fewer than three days of remote work a week: 29.7% aren’t offering any; 10.3% are offering one day; and 16% are offering two.But a majority of employees (also 56.1%) say they want to work remotely for three or more days: 15.6% prefer three; 9.3% prefer four; and 31.2% want to be remote all five days. Workplace experts warn that employers may risk losing more workers if they mandate too many days in the office.When people are asked to work on site full-time but would prefer to work hybrid or fully remote, for example, Gallup’s research found that “employees experience significantly lower engagement, significantly lower well-being, significantly higher intent to leave [and] significantly higher levels of burnout.”At the risk of causing exhausted leaders to run screaming from the building, there is an argument to be made that mandating any number of days in the office could work against companies seeking to strengthen culture and innovation. Culture is about people and behaviors, not place, Lister said. So it behooves companies first to be clear what they want their culture to be and then be more intentional about the ways they cultivate it.As for innovation, in-person work is essential, but so is alone time. The Gensler Research Institute found that even before the pandemic, employees at the most innovative companies only worked in the office about three days a week. “Innovators who spent some time working away from the office reported higher job satisfaction, more meaning, and better managerial relationships. For innovators, the office is just one of the many places where work happens,” researchers wrote. Opinion: Why so many workers are still quitting their jobsWhat the split should be in any given week depends on the task at hand and how an individual and team work best on that task, Janet Pogue McLaurin, the global director of workplace research at Gensler, suggested. “Days of the week [every week] may be the wrong way to think about it.”For some team members, it may make sense some weeks to do all their work remotely, and for others, it may make sense to be in the office all five days, or to just come in a few days or even half days. U.K.-based organizational psychologist Craig Knight, who works with employers to maximize well-being, engagement and productivity, concurs that an arbitrary, top-down mandate isn’t ideal.“The best solutions we’ve always found is when you refer to the experts doing the jobs. And that’s not the [leader],” Knight said.He advises employers to first consult with employees on what their teams’ and the company’s overall goals should be, which could include an understanding that people should be in the office for some time every week. “Set the parameters,” he said.But then leave it to individual teams to negotiate amongst themselves what schedules work best for them to achieve those commonly agreed-upon goals.“Trust them to arrive at a workable solution, and results are almost always superb.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

 Hucksters flourish online, where pushing lies and conspiracy theories can make millions and cultivate followings.But alternate realities do not stand up to cross-examination, as Alex Jones, the founder of Infowars, is learning in a Texas courtroom, where he’s being confronted with his lies about murdered children.Not only did the jury order him to pay $4 million in compensatory damages on Thursday for pushing a conspiracy theory about the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre, but his legal team had apparently accidentally handed over two years of his text messages to the plaintiffs’ attorney. Now the House committee investigating the January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection wants access, perhaps to fact-check Jones’ brag that he financed the rally that day.It is his most loathsome lie, about Sandy Hook, for which Jones will first have to pay.The jury award is less than the $150 million originally sought by the parents of a Sandy Hook victim, but Jones could be ordered to pay more as part of a punitive portion of the proceedings and also potentially in two other lawsuits brought by different Sandy Hook parents in Texas and Connecticut. Read the news report from CNN’s Oliver Darcy.Facing victims. Jones broadcast repeatedly that the Sandy Hook massacre – which killed 26 people, including 20 6- and 7-year-olds – was a hoax and that parents who lost children were actors.So it had to be uncomfortable for Jones to sit in court and hear Scarlett Lewis tell him this week about her dead son.“Jesse was real. I’m a real mom,” she said. See CNN’s full report on that testimony.Too late. Jones has publicly accepted the truth that Sandy Hook was “100% real,” but only now that his failure to cooperate with the court resulted in a default judgment. He’s previously said a “form of psychosis” made him dream up the conspiracy theory.Insulting judge and jury. His company has sought bankruptcy protection ahead of the jury’s deliberation, and his fate is in the hands of jurors he’s characterized as “blue collar” and a judge his company has falsely said helped pedophiles.The judge upbraided him for lying in court when he stood as the only witness for his defense.He told jurors that his previous lies and insults about them on his show were untrue.“I don’t think that you are operatives,” he said at one point. “I don’t think that you are part of a false flag. I don’t think that you are bad people. I think you’re good people. And I just am very, very critical about the whole process.”Caught in a lie. Jones had testified his text messages did not mention Sandy Hook. After his lawyer inadvertently shared a digital copy of the contents of Jones’ cellphone, the lawyer for two Sandy Hook parents said the text messages show that Jones lied.For a good idea of how slippery and slick Jones can be, watch his expressions during this 2017 interview with NBC News in which he never actually admits Sandy Hook occurred, and where he is asked about his ability to inspire Donald Trump.This is his schtick. For an objective look at the facts, read this excellent and in-depth, multipart report from CNN’s Rob Kuznia.Key lines:“With the verbal fluidity of a great talk show host and the excitable charisma of a televangelist, the hard-charging, gravelly voiced Jones has perfected the WWE-ification of the news: It looks professional, but is far from real.If the object of an actual news show is to inform viewers in a compelling way, the object of Infowars is to whip up the ever-dormant flames of populist fear and resentment in service of going viral – without a thought to who gets hurt or who is driven to violence. It’s doom-porn, and the name of the game is to get eyeballs and sell products.”And this:“His tried-and-true schtick has been to declare or strongly imply that high-profile tragedies – from the 9/11 terror attacks to the Boston Marathon bombing to the Sandy Hook massacre to the latest horrific mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde, Texas – were nefarious government plots aimed at tightening control over Americans.”Where lies don’t work. But free speech has limits in court, where lies can be punished as defamation, or worse, perjury, if the lies continue on the witness stand.“Over the past few years, we’ve seen federal and state courts stand strong as a bulwark of truth,” CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig, told me in an email. “Whether it’s Alex Jones or Rudy Giuliani or a 2020 election denier, it’s one thing to spout conspiracy theories on a podcast or social media, but courts demand actual facts and evidence. And, importantly, courts can and will impose accountability and punish people who spread lies for illegal purposes,” Honig said.Jones and January 6. CNN’s Drew Griffin has a special report,“Megaphone for Conspiracy: the Alex Jones Story,” which will re-air on Friday at 11 p.m. ET.During an appearance on CNN on Thursday, Griffin explained why the January 6 committee would want Jones’ text messages.“Alex Jones, based on our reporting and based on Alex Jones’ bragging, quite frankly, said he was very much involved in financing or getting financing for Donald Trump’s rally on the Ellipse that day,” Griffin said. “He was also very instrumental in promoting the idea of a January 6th gathering in Washington.”Ties to Oath Keepers. Griffin also noted that Jones frequently featured Stewart Rhodes, the Oath Keepers founder facing federal seditious conspiracy charges, on Infowars. Rhodes has pleaded not guilty. In Griffin’s special report, he tracks video of Jones during the insurrection, as Jones led a march from the Ellipse toward the east side of the Capitol. In the meantime, rioters attacked the west side. Jones soon left the protest to broadcast for Infowars and was among the first to argue, falsely, that the insurrection was being led by Antifa rather than Trump supporters.“It’s the opposite of Teddy Roosevelt,” said CNN anchor Chris Wallace on “New Day” on Thursday. “Speak loudly and carry a little stick.”“He walked his people right up to the edge of the Capitol, right up the east front of the Capitol … and they all go in and they all face the charges and they all face the police, and he goes back to his perch and oversees it and starts talking about Antifa.”About the election lie. Here’s the turn from Jones and his accountability for Sandy Hook lies and potential accountability for election lies.Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon refused to cooperate with Congress in the January 6 inquiry, and now he’s facing jail time.Trump’s former attorney Rudy Giuliani will testify later this month before a Fulton County, Georgia, grand jury that’s investigating Trump’s attempts to undermine the 2020 election.There has also been movement at the Justice Department, where the January 6 investigation has taken testimony from former White House officials in recent days.Still promising accountability. Attorney General Merrick Garland was asked recently by NBC News if he would be concerned about tearing the country apart by indicting Trump if Trump were to run for president again.“We intend to hold everyone – anyone – who is criminally responsible for the events surrounding January 6, or any attempt to interfere with the lawful transfer of power from one administration to another, accountable,” Garland said. “That’s what we do. We don’t pay any attention to other issues with respect to that.”This story has been updated with additional developments. © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

47,,"The Department of Homeland Security will immediately stop wiping mobile devices of high-level officials and political appointees without backing them up and will launch a 30-day review of policies and practices for retaining text messages and other electronic messages.Secret Service may disable text messaging on employees  phones, memo statesThe move, which was announced as temporary, comes after weeks of heavy criticism over lost text messages at the Secret Service and revelations that the phones of top former DHS officials Ken Cuccinelli and Chad Wolf were wiped after they left office.The moves were announced in a memo sent to department leaders on Thursday.The memo stressed that the items to be retained include email, social media messages, instant messages and text messages.“DHS agencies and offices are directed to preserve either the actual mobile devices (and accompanying access information) or complete fully accessible backups of all device content for all members of the Senior Executive Service or equivalent and political appointees, whenever such an employee departs or would have their device replaced or wiped for any reason,” Chief Information Officer Eric Hysen and General Counsel Jonathan Meyer wrote in the memo.A working group at Homeland Security will review best practices in federal and private sector organizations and provide recommendations to the department regarding training for employees, options for automating backing up text messages and chats, the possibility of restricting electronic messages and department policies for retaining electronic messages.“As technology continues to rapidly evolve, the working group will ensure DHS continues to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and guidance so as to fully meet the expectations of Congress and our other oversight entities, other key stakeholders, and the American public,” Chief Information Officer Eric Hysen and General Counsel Jonathan Meyer wrote in a memo to DHS leaders.Department officials familiar with how the agency will implement changes told CNN that under current policy, text messages pertaining to agency business must be retained if there isn’t another record of the information.A 2018 DHS directive regarding text message retention notes that not all text messages are considered official federal records and that “any communication in which an Agency decision or commitment is made or where an action is committed to, that is not otherwise documented, needs to be captured.” But for nearly all department employees, emails are retained automatically and over a longer period of time. And for higher-level employees, such as political appointees and top deputies, records retention rules are more stringent than for regular employees.For example, all emails for those in the top posts are preserved. But it was left to individuals to decide whether to preserve text messages. So DHS is now exploring shifting that responsibility from the individual to instead automate retention. The working group will focus on finding options for possibly automatically retaining those communications.The officials noted the technology around texting is different than email, largely because of systems like encrypted IMessage, which presents a challenge in automatically capturing communications.The officials also told CNN that DHS is exploring restricting text messages or other chats. Secret Service Director James Murray issued a memo to employees on Wednesday indicating that texting may be disabled on that agency’s mobile phones.The DHS memo was issued a day after Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks instructed Defense Department leaders that “users of DoD mobile devices that under existing DoD instructions, DoD users are required to retain text messages that qualify as federal records,” acting press secretary Todd Breasseale said in a statement Thursday.American Oversight, a third-party watchdog organization, requested cell phone records from top DoD officials who were in office when the January 6 Capitol attack occurred, including former Secretary of Defense Chris Miller, former chief of staff Kash Patel and former Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy. Their cell phone records were wiped when they resigned from their positions at the end of January 2021, according to court documents. “Retention of records as required by the Federal Records Act is a solemn responsibility and legal obligation for all federal employees, civilian and military,” Hicks said in the memo. “DoD personnel are reminded that … users must retain text messages that qualify as records under the Federal Records Act.”The memo further established that “effective immediately” all mobile device service providers in DoD “will capture and save the data resident on DoD-provisioned mobile devices when devices are turned in by users.”Hicks directed the DoD Chief Information Officer and DoD General Counsel to “assess DoD policies and procedures” for ensuring Federal Records Act compliance. The CIO and General Counsel are required to report back to Hicks in 30 days “with any further recommended actions.” “The department will be transparent with Congress and the public on records retrieval and stewardship,” Breasseale said in the statement. Former Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy’s and former Undersecretary of the Army James McPherson’s cell phones were “not properly archived,” a separate defense official told CNN. “There was no nefarious intent,” behind the records not being archived, the official added.Separately, Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. James McConville and Director of the Army Staff Gen. Walter Piatt had their phones replaced in the spring of 2021, as a part of standard protocol. “All of the Army officials did exactly what” they were told to do, the official said.Miller, Patel and McCarthy have all been viewed as crucial witnesses for understanding the government’s response to the January 6 Capitol assault and Trump’s reaction to the breach. There is no suggestion that the officials themselves erased the records.American Oversight is now calling for a “cross-agency investigation” by the Justice Department to investigate destruction of the materials.“It’s just astounding to believe that the agency did not understand the importance of preserving its records – particularly [with regards] to the top officials that might have captured: what they were doing, when they were doing it, why they were doing, it on that day,” Heather Sawyer, American Oversight’s executive director, told CNN.CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that the wiping of mobile devices of high-level DHS officials is temporary.

48,,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that a congressional delegation traveled to South Korea and visited the Korean Demilitarized Zone that divides North and South Korea.“It was a privilege to engage with American heroes in uniform on the ground in Korea, led by General Paul LaCamera, Commander, U.S. Forces Korea. During visits to the Demilitarized Zone/Joint Security Area (DMZ/JSA) and Osan Air Base, we conveyed the gratitude of the Congress and the Country for the patriotic service of our Servicemembers, who stand as sentinels of Democracy on the Korean peninsula,” Pelosi said in the statement.The DMZ is a 160-mile-long no-man’s land about 30 miles north of Seoul that was established in the 1953 Korean War Armistice Agreement. It is often described as the world’s most heavily armed border. Pelosi said the delegation also visited Seoul and praised what she described as “a strong bond” between the US and South Korea. “The United States and South Korea share a strong bond formed for security and forged by decades of warm friendship. Our Congressional delegation traveled to Seoul to reaffirm our treasured ties and our shared commitment to advancing security and stability, economic growth and democratic governance,” Pelosi said. Pelosi said the delegation was “honored to be hosted” at a parliamentary meeting “where we reaffirmed our commitment to the U.S.-Korea alliance” and “was pleased to engage in a phone meeting with Korea’s President Yoon Suk-yeol.” Providing a readout of the call, Pelosi said, “we thanked the President for Korea’s hospitality of 28,000 U.S. Servicemembers and their families. Each Member engaged in conversation with the President, highlighting areas of continued cooperation to advance a free and open Indo-Pacific.” The announcement comes after Pelosi recently visited Taiwan amid threats of Chinese retaliation.Pelosi landed in Taipei on Tuesday, marking a significant show of support for Taiwan. Pelosi’s stop in Taipei is the first time that a US House speaker has visited Taiwan in 25 years. Her trip comes at a low point in US-China relations and despite warnings from the Biden administration against a stop in Taiwan.This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.CNN’s Jeremy Herb and Sol Han contributed to this report.

49,,"Former Vice President Dick Cheney criticizes former President Donald Trump as a “threat to our republic” and a “coward” in a new campaign ad for his daughter, Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who’s facing a competitive Republican primary later this month. “In our nation’s 246-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” the former vice president says in the 60-second spot released Thursday. “He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him.” “He is a coward. A real man wouldn’t lie to his supporters. He lost his election and he lost big. I know it, he knows it and, deep down, I think most Republicans know it,” Cheney says.He goes on to say he “proudly voted” for his daughter, who is the vice chair of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection. “There is nothing more important she will ever do than lead the effort to make sure Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office.”Though Cheney has occasionally criticized Trump and his administration’s policies, the new ad underscores his deep opposition to the former President, who has made defeating Liz Cheney a top political priority after she voted to impeach him last year and has remained a vocal critic.Trump has endorsed Harriet Hageman in the August 16 primary, who’s one of four challengers taking on the three-term congresswoman for the nomination for the at-large House seat. Her rivals have attacked Cheney over her role as one of two Republicans on the January 6 panel, and have dismissed that probe’s importance.Like Trump, Hageman has made false claims about the 2020 election, citing the “2000 Mules” film that peddles conspiracy theories about ballot drop boxes and “Zuckerberg money” – a reference to donations from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, through a nonprofit to help local elections officials navigate the coronavirus pandemic.CNN’s Eric Bradner and David Wright contributed to this report.

50,,"Bibi the hippo gave birth Wednesday night, the Cincinnati Zoo said in a tweet Thursday. “Bibi gave birth around 10 p.m. and all seems to be going well for Mom and baby so far,” the zoo said. “They will remain off habitat for about 2 weeks to bond.”A name is likely to be discussed today, Jenna Wingate, a senior zookeeper with the zoo’s Africa Team, told CNN New Day Thursday.“We’ve had our focus on just having this healthy calf come out into the world and keeping our focus on Bibi,” said Wingate.“We are so happy to say that the baby is strong and looking really healthy so far,” Wingate said.That means Fiona, Bibi’s daughter, is officially a big sister. Fiona became an international celebrity after being born six weeks prematurely in 2017, weighing in at only 29 pounds at birth. Hippos are typically born at closer to 100 pounds. Fiona’s weight was a record-breaking low weight for a hippo, but she managed to survive against all odds, CNN previously reported. Fiona now weighs about 1,300 pounds. Wingate said the zoo was “cautiously optimistic” about Bibi’s latest pregnancy given how prematurely Fiona was born.“This calf seems to be really healthy,” Wingate said. “We haven’t gotten a weight on this one yet but we are estimating it be over 50 pounds for sure, and usually they’re about 50-100 pounds.” The zoo said in a news release that Bibi and her baby “will not be visible to the public right away,” but that it’s working to “share photos and videos if the care team is able to get them without disturbing them.”Thursday afternoon the zoo posted a video of the bouncing new baby hippo bobbing around in an indoor pool.“The newborn hippo has spent most of the day in the indoor pools with Bibi, exploring, resting and nursing, which is exactly what the hippo care team was hoping for,” the zoo said on Twitter. “Hippos spend most of their life in water and hippo calves even nurse underwater.”Top image: A new baby hippo was born at Cincinnati Zoo on Wednesday night.

 Brits are bracing for another huge hike in their energy bills, and pressure is mounting on the UK government to impose a windfall tax on big suppliers to offset some of the pain. The head of Ofgem, the United Kingdom’s energy regulator, said on Tuesday that annual bills for millions of households would likely rise by about another £800 ($1,000) to £2,800 ($3,494) later this year. The new rises would kick in starting October when Ofgem next adjusts its price cap, which is the maximum suppliers can charge customers per unit of energy. In April, the regulator raised the cap by a whopping 54% — the biggest increase since it began capping prices five years ago.“We are expecting a price cap in October in the region of £2,800,” Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem’s chief executive, told a parliamentary committee.Brearley said that the regulator had yet to complete its review of prices, and the cap could still change, but he acknowledged that it was a “very distressing time for customers.”“This news will be utterly devastating for the 6.1 million homes currently in fuel poverty — and for the additional 1.7 million households who will spend this winter struggling to keep themselves warm,” Simon Francis, coordinator for the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, a campaign group, told CNN Business. “Unless the government acts now, it will have blood on its hands this winter,” he added. For months, campaigners and opposition politicians have called for a windfall tax on the bumper profits of energy companies at a time when households and businesses have struggled to keep the lights on. The money raised could be handed to people in the greatest need of help with their bills.Companies such as BP(BP) and Shell(RDSA) have benefited from rising global oil and natural gas prices, which shot even higher in recent months as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked fears of a global supply crunch. So far, the UK government has resisted imposing any new taxes. On Tuesday, Energy Minister Kwasi Kwarteng reiterated his opposition to a windfall tax, according to Reuters, arguing that it was not the right approach to tackle the soaring cost-of-living crisis. But the decision rests with the country’s finance minster, Rishi Sunak — and he may finally be listening to campaigners. The Financial Times reported on Tuesday that Sunak was preparing to tax the profits of North Sea oil and gas producers — a measure the opposition Labour Party estimates could raise £2 billion ($2.5 billion) — and go even further by raking in more than £10 billion ($13 billion) from big electricity generating companies such as EDF (ECIFY)and RWE(RWEOY).

53,,"Proponents of Donald Trump’s discredited lie about rampant fraud in 2020 are running for positions of authority over election administration in virtually every state expected to decide the 2024 presidential race, an explosive trend dramatically underscored by Tuesday’s bitterly contested Georgia Republican primary.In Georgia, Trump may achieve, at best, only mixed success Tuesday with the slate of election-denier candidates he has endorsed in primaries against Republicans, led by Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who certified President Joe Biden’s narrow 2020 win in the state.But even losses for some of Trump’s candidates in Georgia – and that seems much more likely in the governor than secretary of state race – wouldn’t reverse the larger trend: Republicans across the country are steadily nominating candidates echoing Trump’s falsehoods about the 2020 election in contests for governor, attorney general and secretary of state. Republicans look to Georgia for a path beyond Trump s 2020 grievances“What we’re seeing right now is unprecedented,” says Joanna Lydgate, co-founder and CEO of States United Action, a bipartisan group tracking threats to election integrity across the country. “To see candidates running on a platform of lies and conspiracy theories about our elections as a campaign position, to see a former President getting involved in endorsing in down-ballot races at the primary level, and certainly to see this kind of systemic attacks on our elections, this spreading of disinformation about our elections – we’ve never seen anything like this before as a country.”Republican candidates echoing Trump’s disproven claims of fraud about 2020 have already been nominated, or are seeking nominations, for positions with control over election machinery in all five of the states that flipped from supporting Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020 – Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Republican candidates touting similar arguments are also in strong positions to win GOP nominations for key election positions in states just outside that inner circle of most competitive contests, including secretary of state races in Nevada, Minnesota and Colorado.And even as these candidates are advancing, Republican legislators are moving a flurry of bills to change the rules for both voter access and election administration. Down one track, as has been widely reported, 19 Republican-controlled states approved bills in 2021 making it more difficult to vote. Less widely discussed has been a second track: an exhaustive study released last week by three election reform groups found that 13 states have already approved laws allowing for more partisan control of election administration, imposing greater penalties on election administrators for alleged violations, or requiring highly partisan audits of the 2020 results, with another 229 bills still pending in 33 states.“Taken separately, each of these bills would chip away at the system of free and fair elections that Americans have sustained, and worked to improve, for generations,” the groups concluded. “Taken together, they could lead to an election in which the voters’ choices are disregarded and the election sabotaged.”This two-front offensive revolving around efforts to both change the election laws and who administers those laws could reconfigure the fundamental landscape for the 2024 election much more than most Americans, or even many political leaders, seem aware. It could also thrust the nation into incendiary turmoil about the legitimacy of the next presidential result, no matter who wins. “It’s all connected,” says Lydgate. “The playbook is to try to change the rules and change the referees, so you can change the results.”Republicans echoing Trump’s claims and disputing the 2020 outcome include gubernatorial candidates in 24 states, secretary of state aspirants in 18 and attorneys general hopefuls in 14, according to tracking by States United. That means election deniers are seeking nominations in about two-thirds of the states choosing governors and secretaries of state this year, and in about half of those selecting attorneys general.“In the leadup to the 2020 election, those who warned of a potential crisis were dismissed as alarmists by far too many Americans who should have seen the writing on the wall,” Jessica Marsden, counsel at Protect Democracy, another bipartisan group tracking threats to future elections, wrote in an email. “Almost two years later, after an attempted coup and a violent insurrection on our Capitol, election conspiracy theorists – including those who actually participated in January 6 – are being nominated by the GOP to hold the most consequential offices for overseeing the 2024 election.”The Republican Secretaries of State committee did not respond to a request for comment on the charge that some of its candidates could threaten the integrity of future elections.Not all of these candidates, of course, will win GOP nominations for these sensitive posts. But the list is growing of election deniers who have already done so. The most prominent example came last week when Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who led Trump’s efforts to overturn the state’s results from 2020 and marched toward the Capitol on January 6 (though he says he didn’t enter the building), won the GOP nomination for governor in the Keystone state. In Michigan, the GOP state party convention recently nominated election deniers for both secretary of state and attorney general; Kristina Karamo, the GOP’s secretary of state nominee, has flatly declared that Trump won Michigan (a state he lost by over 150,000 votes) and that leftist agitators actually carried out the attack on the Capitol. Karamo has also asserted that Jocelyn Benson, Michigan’s Democratic Secretary of State, should be jailed. The Minnesota Republican Party has endorsed as its secretary of state candidate another election denier, Kim Crockett, who played a video at the state party convention showing election officials (including the state’s Jewish Secretary of State Steve Simon) under the control of Jewish financier George Soros; the state GOP chair last week publicly apologized for the video (but defended Crockett). In Idaho, former US Rep. Raul Labrador last week ousted incumbent Attorney General Lawrence Wasden in a GOP primary that centered on Wasden’s refusal to join the 2020 lawsuit from Texas that sought to tip the presidency to Trump by invalidating the votes in four key states Biden won. Trump claims Republicans will stay home in November if his pick doesn t win the GOP gubernatorial primary in Georgia. Voters say otherwiseGeorgia isn’t likely to expand this list as much as Trump hoped. Local leaders told me Trump angered Georgia Republican activists – even many who agree with his claims about 2020 – by targeting so many of the state’s GOP officials for primary challenges. In the marquee race, former Sen. David Perdue, Trump’s instrument for vengeance against Kemp, has run a listless campaign and is expected to be trounced. Attorney General Chuck Carr, another target of the former President’s ire, also appears likely to reach 50% of the vote and avoid a runoff against a Trump-backed challenger who has struggled to raise money.But State Sen. Burt Jones, a Trump endorsee who has endorsed his conspiracy theories, is the front-runner in the race for lieutenant governor, after the Republican incumbent Geoff Duncan, who criticized the former President’s efforts to overturn the 2020 result, chose not to seek reelection. And Rep. Jody Hice, the Trump-backed candidate for secretary of state, could force a runoff with Raffensperger, even though the incumbent has tried to buttress his conservative credentials by calling for amendments to the Georgia and US constitutions to prevent voting from non-citizens, which is already illegal. Hice has said Trump would have won Georgia in 2020 if the election was “fair” and recently told reporters he saw nothing wrong with Trump’s call to Raffensperger, in which Trump pressured the secretary to “find” enough votes for him to win the state. (That call is at the center of an ongoing Fulton County grand jury investigation of Trump.) A runoff would probably favor Hice because more moderate GOP voters might be less likely to turn out again to defend Raffensperger once the higher-visibility governor’s contest has been decided, says Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia.However Georgia plays out, the conveyor belt of Trump-style election deniers is likely to continue advancing through GOP primaries. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who led that lawsuit against the 2020 result, is favored to win his runoff primary Tuesday against Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush. Candidates echoing Trump’s fraud claims are in strong positions to win GOP secretary of state nominations in June primaries in Nevada and Colorado (where the GOP convention gave the most support for the position to Tina Peters, the Mesa County elections clerk currently under indictment for tampering with election equipment). Election deniers are strongly positioned as well in the gubernatorial and secretary of state primaries in Arizona, where two leading contenders for the latter position are state legislators Mark Finchem and Shawnna Bolick, who both signed a letter asking Congress to throw out the Arizona results and award the state’s Electoral College votes to Trump. (None of the major candidates for the GOP attorney general nomination in Arizona would agree Biden legitimately won the state when recently surveyed by the Arizona Republic.) In Wisconsin, one of the GOP’s leading gubernatorial contenders, Lt. Gov Rebecca Kleefisch recently declared the 2020 election in the state was “rigged” despite multiple studies finding no evidence of fraud.“These folks are running on platforms of preordained winners for 2024,” charges Kim Rogers, executive director of the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State. “It is not about counting ballots; it is about changing the results for their preferred candidate.”The steady advance of GOP candidates parroting Trump’s claims reflects both the widespread acceptance of his fraud allegations among Republican voters – 70% of GOP partisans said Biden did not win the election legitimately in a CNN poll earlier this year – and the refusal of any other key institutions in the Republican coalition, from elected officials to business leaders, to systematically push back against those claims. In Georgia, Trump has faced a generalized backlash over his heavy-handed intervention, but no specific effort emerged from business or elected Republicans to defend Raffensperger. In Colorado former state GOP chair Dick Wadhams sees the same thing. Asked if there was any effort in the party to contest the fraud claims, he replied: “To answer it very simply: no there isn’t.”Ian Bassin, Protect Democracy’s executive director, says that pattern is apparent around the country, especially after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the GOP-controlled state legislature retaliated against Disney for its criticism of what opponents have called their “don’t say gay” legislation.“Scholars of the rise and fall of democracies have identified the business sector as often one of the most important bulwarks against authoritarianism,” Bassin says. “But … the attitude inside too many C-suites today after seeing what happened to Disney is to keep their heads down and retreat from playing any role in the current battle for democracy.” Republican elected officials have been even more reluctant to challenge these claims: “This is where the failure has been the most extreme.”In several of these Republican primary contests, the biggest threat to the election deniers may be multiple candidates splitting that vote. That’s what happened in the recent Idaho secretary of state primary when a more mainstream candidate, Ada County Clerk Phil McGrane, won with only 43% against two election-denying opponents. The same dynamic could play out in the Colorado and Arizona secretary of state races. And just as Raffensperger supporters are hoping that crossover Democratic voters might bolster him in Georgia, Wadhams says more independents than usual might participate in the Colorado GOP primary to block Peters and gubernatorial aspirant Greg Lopez, who has said that if elected he would pardon her. (Lopez has also endorsed an “electoral college” type system for statewide elections that would end one-person, one-vote and magnify the influence of rural areas.)To see candidates running on a platform of lies and conspiracy theories about our elections as a campaign position, to see a former president getting involved in endorsing in down ballot races at the primary level, and certainly to see this kind of systemic attacks on our elections, this spreading of disinformation about our elections – we’ve never seen anything like this before as a country. Joanna Lydgate, co-founder and CEO of States United ActionBoth at the national and state level, Democrats have not found a way to make these potential threats to democracy tangible or relevant to voters, analysts in both parties agree. The prospect that the Supreme Court may overturn the right to abortion could give them a second chance by bundling threats to voting and election integrity into a larger argument that Republicans are trying to roll back rights across a broad front.Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination last week, may have made the most progress in the party toward forging that argument. “It’s not freedom when they get to dictate to the women of Pennsylvania how and when and under what terms they’re going to start a family. It’s not freedom when they tell our children what books they can read. And it sure as hell isn’t freedom when they go out and say, sure, you can vote, but we get to pick the winner,” Shapiro insisted in a recent television appearance.Such arguments may prove effective in some places. Yet in a midterm political environment so favorable for Republicans, it’s highly likely some of the candidates trumpeting Trump’s big lie will win positions providing them control over election administration and tabulation – and that could present unprecedented challenges sooner than later. “There could be chaos in 2024,” says Wadhams, the former Colorado GOP chair. Chillingly, that chaos could be the most intense precisely in the states most likely to decide the next race for control of the White House. © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

54,,"Wimbledon’s decision to ban Russian and Belarusian players from this year’s tournament following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is “wrong,” world number one Novak Djokovic said on Monday.Wimbledon, the third of the four grand slams on the tennis calendar, is arguably the most famous tennis tournament in the world. But this year, the men’s and women’s professional tours, along with the International Tennis Federation (ITF), have opted to strip the grand slam of its ranking points following the decision from the tournament’s organizers to ban Russians and Belarusians from playing in this year’s event. “Collectively, I am glad that players got together and showed to the grand slam that when there is a mistake happening we have to show there will be some consequences,” Djokovic told reporters on Monday. Tennis tours strip ranking points at Wimbledon over decision to ban Russian and Belarusian playersThe ban on Russian players will prevent several high ranked players from competing at the iconic grass court slam.“I think it (Wimbledon’s ban) was a wrong decision. I don’t support that at all. But at these times, it is a sensitive subject and whatever you decide will create a lot of conflict,” he added.The All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) said in a statement Friday it stands by its decision. Wimbledon organizers said in April that Russians and Belarusians would not be allowed to compete at this year’s tournament.In a statement, the AELTC said it remained “unwilling to accept success or participation at Wimbledon being used to benefit the propaganda machine of the Russian regime, which, through its closely controlled State media, has an acknowledged history of using sporting success to support a triumphant narrative to the Russian people.“We therefore wish to state our deep disappointment at the decisions taken by the ATP, WTA and ITF in removing ranking points for The Championships. We believe these decisions to be disproportionate in the context of the exceptional and extreme circumstances of this situation and the position we found ourselves in, and damaging to all players who compete on Tour,” the statement added.Tennis governing bodies had banned Russia and Belarus from international team competitions following the invasion.However, individual players from the countries are allowed to compete on the ATP and WTA Tours but not under the name or flag of their countries.Djokovic said he would still play at Wimbledon this year but criticized the lack of “strong communication” from organizers.“On a personal level, of course, without getting a chance to play and defend my 4,000 points from Australia and Wimbledon, I will drop them this year,” he said.“It’s a very unique and weird situation but a grand slam is a grand slam,” he said, adding that Wimbledon “has always been my dream since I was a kid.” Daniil Medvedev still hopeful of playing in Wimbledon“I don’t look at it through the lens of points or prize money, but there has to be some standards with some mutual respect,” he said.“This is one of these kinds of decisions where there will always be someone who will suffer more. It is a lose-lose situation.”Meanwhile, four-time grand slam champion Naomi Osaka said she is not sure she will play Wimbledon this year, calling the tournament without points “like an exhibition.”“The intention of this measure was good, but the execution is all over the place,” she said on Monday.“I feel like if I play Wimbledon without points, it’s more like an exhibition. I know this isn’t true, right? But my brain just like feels that way. Whenever I think like something is like an exhibition, I just can’t go at it 100%.“I didn’t even make my decision yet, but I’m leaning more towards not playing given the current circumstances,” she added.Issy Ronald and Jill Martin contributed reporting.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/24/tennis/djokovic-wimbledon-russia-ukraine-intl-spt/index.html
55,,"The House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol Hill insurrection is preparing to delay its next round of hearings into July, the committee’s chairman, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, said Wednesday.The committee will still hold its next hearing on Thursday, which will focus on then-President Donald Trump’s pressure campaign on the Justice Department to intervene in the 2020 election, but then plans to take a break before holding another round of hearings next month.Thompson said the committee needs more time to go through the new documentary footage it received from documentarian Alex Holder, who possesses never-before-seen footage of Trump and his family, new information from the National Archives, and new tips coming in through the panel’s tip line since the hearings started in order to move forward with its hearings. Thompson said he has reviewed some of the footage Holder provided to the committee, and characterized it as “important.”The schedule is still very fluid and is subject to change, but a round of hearings in July is the current goal. The House is scheduled to be in recess until the week of July 11, so Thompson said it is likely the hearings will not resume until “after the recess.”A committee aide told CNN the committee could provide more insight into their schedule during Thursday’s hearing.“The Select Committee continues to receive additional evidence relevant to our investigation into the violence of January 6th and its causes,” the aide said. “Following tomorrow’s hearing, we will be holding additional hearings in the coming weeks. We will announce dates and times for those hearings soon.” © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

56,,"They’ve already rowed across the Atlantic, flown over Australia with paramotors and traveled to some of the world’s most remote places.Now UK adventurers Hugo and Ross Turner, also known as the Turner Twins, are heading off on a brand new adventure – a 100% emission free expedition to the Atlantic Pole of Inaccessibility (POI).Known as the Blue Pole Project powered by Quintet Earth, the voyage, likely to take around six weeks, will see the pair set sail from the UK, via the Canary Islands and the Azores archipelago, to the point in the Atlantic Ocean furthest away from land in any direction.The Turner Twins, who are scheduled to depart towards the end of June, will travel on a 12-meter yacht fitted with a prototype hydrogen fuel cell in a bid to put the spotlight on hydrogen fuel technology, as well as ocean advocacy. She s visited every country in the world. Here s what she learnedThey”ll also rely on hydrogen, which is created using renewable energy rather than fossil fuels, to power all of their equipment.The pair, who’ve already traveled to four of the Poles of Inaccessibility, are collecting data for Plymouth University’s International Marine Litter Research Unit that will be used to help develop a clean up strategy for marine plastic pollution“The core of what we’re trying to do is discover something new,” Ross Turner tells CNN Travel. “To be curious and use new technology and science to make our trips more sustainable.“And if we can prove that they [the new technologies] are more sustainable in these extreme environments, then it should give a good example for everyone back in cities and normal life that the new sustainable technologies are very much user friendly every day.”The Turner Twins, who haven’t been on a major expedition since 2019, say they’re hugely excited about their upcoming adventure.Their adventures together began at a young age. The pair say they spent much of their time “getting lost in their garden” during their younger years, before they were old enough to explore Dartmoor National Park, a vast moorland in Devon, southwest England close to the home they grew up in.However, it was a freak accident that led to Hugo Turner breaking his neck and subsequently having neck reconstruction at the age of 17 that set them on the path to becoming professional adventurers.“I think for us, life got put into perspective,” says Ross Turner. “And we just thought, we’ve got to go and live life while we’ve got our health.“So we rode across the Atlantic when we were 23. And since then, we’ve just gone on to more expeditions.”A post shared by 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗧𝗨𝗥𝗡𝗘𝗥 𝗧𝗪𝗜𝗡𝗦 (@theturnertwiins) Those expeditions include climbing 18,510 feet to the snow summit of Mount Elbrus in Russia and attempting to cross the Greenland ice cap.While each of these journeys has taught them something, they single out their journey to the South American Pole of Inaccessibility, which they traveled to in 2017, as being one of the most challenging.“What an idiotic trip that was,” says Hugo Turner. “They say ignorance is bliss. Going from the west coast of South America and Arica, the northern tip of Chile, up and over the Andes was a very stupid idea. “We went from sea level to 4,700 meters in about three days, with around 50 or 60 kilograms on each bike, through deserts and just straight uphill.” Once they’ve completed this latest journey, the Turner Twins will be the first people to have reached five of the POIs – Australian, North American, South America, Iberia and the Atlantic, although they stress that this isn’t the motivation for them at all. The Scottish adventurer who s riding across Europe on horseback“It’s never been that important to us to be the first to reach these polls of accessibility,” says Hugo Turner, explaining that their central aim is for those who follow their journey to learn something through it.“Whether that’s environmental sustainability, medical research, geographical – because none of these polls have been documented – that’s really what the whole base of these expeditions is, to discover something.”They’ve had to come up with various solutions to ensure that their upcoming voyage remains totally emission free, but say the process has been “relatively easy” in many ways.“In terms of propulsion, as long as you’ve got an electric battery, once the battery is drained, we sail and the propeller recharges the engine,” says Ross Turner.“We’re using the same systems we’ve used across all our other expeditions, with little tweaks to make it more sustainable or emission free. “We’re just applying everything we’ve learned in a slightly different way.”As they prepare for yet another significant jaunt together, each of the Turner Twins feel extremely grateful to have a constant companion who shares the same dreams.“We’re amazingly lucky,” says Hugo Turner. “Because we both have exactly the same goals and aspirations, and we’re completely aligned on where we want to go. Everything else just follows that. “There are certainly heated arguments, debates and conversations about how to get to the endpoint.The most remote places on Earth“But you know, that always steers the ship. So we’re both on board with that. It’s the backbone of what makes this a successful partnership.” The lead up to the Blue Pole Project has been particularly “intense” – they’ve been spending around 16 hours a day on the yacht for weeks in order to get it ready – and both admit they’re itching to get started. “I’m looking forward to sailing under the stars with this boat,” says Ross Turner. “And I’m sure we’ll have lots of beautiful moments.”Once they’ve completed the expedition to the Atlantic POI, the pair will set off on a tour of the UK, stopping at around 13 port cities.So what’s next for the Turner Twins? Greenland, Madagascar, Eurasia and Point Nemo – the other Poles of Inaccessibility, of course. A post shared by 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗧𝗨𝗥𝗡𝗘𝗥 𝗧𝗪𝗜𝗡𝗦 (@theturnertwiins) According to Ross Turner, an expedition to Madagascar is “on the horizon” next year, then a trip to Greenland the year after. The Eurasian POI would be next on the list, but a potential visit here is currently in doubt.Although its exact location is disputed, the possible locations lie in the northern part of Xinjiang, an autonomous territory in northwest China that’s been subject to allegations of human rights abuses. “Whether we can get there, I don’t know,” he adds, before explaining that they’re planning to travel to Point Nemo, the Pacific Ocean’s POI, last.They have no plans to visit the African POI, which is situated near the joining of the borders of the Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC,) and South Sudan.Sustainability remains at the forefront of their minds while they continue their epic adventures around the world, and the pair hope they can help to normalize the use of the hydrogen. “It will be great to be able to do a fully hydrogen-powered project in the future,” says Hugo Turner. “That would be a really good step in the right direction.”Follow the Turner Twins on their epic journey via their official website, or through their Instagram account © 2023 Cable News Network.

57,,"Chronicling the history of a band devoted to chaos and anarchy makes for a messy subject, which might explain why “Pistol” – a six-part limited series about the rise of the Sex Pistols – is such a dreary exercise. Director Danny Boyle meticulously replicates the period, but despite plenty of sex, drugs, rock and rage, this Hulu presentation feels more like a coffee-table book than a fully realized drama.Adapted from guitarist Steve Jones’ memoir “Lonely Boy: Tales from a Sex Pistol,” the narrative largely unfolds from his point of view, as played by Toby Wallace. Inspired by the likes of David Bowie, the Pistols (originally dubbing themselves the Swankers) funneled their energy and anger into the music, embodying their working-class roots and rootlessness, as well as their hostility toward authority in all its myriad forms.“Actually, we’re not into music,” Jones tells a reporter, once the band starts to take off. “We’re into chaos.”Gradually, the group finds lead singer John Lydon, a.k.a. Johnny Rotten (Anson Boone), while Jones carries on a secret relationship with Chrissie Hynde (Sydney Chandler), destined for fame of her own as the lead singer of the Pretenders. (As a footnote, Lydon unsuccessfully sued to prevent the group’s music from being used, adding a little off-screen spice to the stew.)Others in the cast include Louis Partridge and Emma Appleton, respectively, as Sid Vicious and his girlfriend Nancy, whose tragic tale was previously documented in the 1986 movie; and “Game of Thrones” alum Maisie Williams as punk icon Jordan, although given the modest size of the role, her contribution stems more from its promotional value than the actual story.As for that story, Boyle (whose most germane credits include “Trainspotting” and its sequel) and writer/producer Craig Pearce (“Moulin Rouge!”) careen through a semi-psychedelic rendition of those violent, screaming, wild performances, and how London’s punk rock iteration of youthful rebellion unsettled the existing social order.Simply put, nihilism might be provocative, but it can also be kind of, well, dull. Nor do the real-life underpinnings prevent the project from exhibiting some of the usual “A Star is Born”-esque show-business cliches.As one would expect from a project about the Sex Pistols, there will be blood, sex and more than a little spit. What there isn’t, once you get past the grimy 1970s nostalgia of it all, is much that, dramatically speaking, leaves a significant mark.“Pistol” premieres May 31 on Hulu. © 2023 Cable News Network.

 The US cannabis industry is flush with fledgling companies and many unfamiliar brands. In that mix, however, is a 154-year-old company that is a household name: Scotts Miracle-Gro(SMG). Over the past decade, the lawn and garden giant has quietly entrenched itself in the young and fast-growing industry. Its Hawthorne Gardening Company subsidiary has scooped up the biggest players in hydroponics, lighting and other supplies used for growing. Now, Scotts is ramping up its involvement by throwing its lobbying weight behind legalization efforts, and funneling money into investments that eventually could enable the company to sell cannabis directly to consumers.“It’s our belief, and this is not a grand revelation by any stretch: Federal legalization is obviously going to happen; the question is when and how,” said Chris Hagedorn, executive vice president of Scotts and division president of Hawthorne. “When it does, what are the most valuable assets going to be in a post-legalization world? I think anybody who thinks about it for a while says consumer-facing brands [that make and sell cannabis products] will be the most valuable.”Scotts’ emergence as a cannabis leader should come as no surprise. Back in 2011, when 16 states had legalized medical marijuana, Scotts CEO Jim Hagedorn, Chris Hagedorn’s father, told the Wall Street Journal he saw potential in this growing agricultural category. “I want to target the pot market,” he said at the time. “There’s no good reason we haven’t.”To do so, Scotts couldn’t hop right in. Marijuana’s federally illegal status as a Schedule I substance prevents companies on the major stock exchanges from establishing “plant-touching” operations, such as cannabis growers, manufacturers and retailers.So the company instead went the “picks and shovels” route by targeting the tools used to supply the industry. Scotts started small by first making a $4.5 million bet on a struggling indoor gardening products company AeroGrow, then quickly accelerated its plans. In 2014, Scotts formed Hawthorne, its hydroponics-focused subsidiary, and then dropped nearly half a billion dollars buying sector leaders such as hydroponics supply firm General Hydroponics, lighting company Gavita and nutrients maker Botanicare. In the years since, more companies have been brought under the Hawthorne umbrella, making it a significant arm of Scotts’ business – especially during the pandemic, when industries such as cannabis and home improvement saw huge sales gains.“If people are stuck at home, what are they going to do? They smoke a joint and go garden,” Chris Hagedorn said. “And that’s pretty much what happened, so the consumer business [of Scotts] saw a huge boost, we did as well.”In 2021, Hawthorne comprised nearly 30%, or $1.4 billion, of Scotts’ overall sales, up from 25% in 2020 and a 20% share in 2019, the company’s annual filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show.But boom times don’t last forever. Supply chain challenges, rising inflation and consumers pulling back on spending have created choppy waters for many businesses, including Hawthorne, which saw sales drop by 44% to $202.6 million (Scotts’ overall sales declined 8% to $1.68 billion) during its second quarter.Moreover, those in the cannabis industry are facing some unique pressures, Chris Hagedorn said.“The current slowdown is really the result of a perfect storm that is hitting growers hard,” he said. “There is oversupply in key markets such as California and Oklahoma, and inflation is causing increases in the cost of raw materials and services. We expect the industry to bounce back as these key markets work through the excess supply and as new markets come on line in the Northeast over the next 12 to 18 months.”The Northeast is expected to be home to some of the largest cannabis markets in the nation, once states such as New Jersey and New York reach maturity – likely four or five years after sales begin. New Jersey started selling adult-use cannabis last month; and New York, which is currently finalizing regulations and its licensing structure, is expected to begin sales later this year.The region also holds some significance for Scotts, which contributed $800,000 of the $1.3 billion raised by pro-legalization committees in New Jersey, and has connections to a New York cannabis operation.In late March, a New York-based dispensary reached an agreement to be acquired by cannabis investment firm RIV Capital for $247 million. RIV Capital, headed by Scotts executive Mark Sims, is bankrolled in part by The Hawthorne Collective, a Scotts subsidiary.If approved, the deal could in effect set the stage for Scotts to eventually own a piece of the plant-touching side of the business. Until cannabis is federally legal in the US, Hawthorne Collective’s investments in RIV cannot directly fund plant-touching businesses; however, the money could be used for general corporate and other lawful purposes.Andrew Carter, a Stifel analyst who covers Scotts, said he believes the company has a strong long-term view.“Absent some kind of change at the company, I would argue that they’re going to be a big player in cannabis, somehow, some way,” Carter said.Chris Hagedorn said Hawthorne will continue to expand its presence in the industry:“I hope we will be amongst the leaders. If not, I will be disappointed in myself,” he said. Most stock quote data provided by BATS. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

61,,"President Joe Biden on Tuesday said the pain was “palpable” when he met with grieving families in Uvalde, Texas, this weekend following a mass shooting at an elementary school that claimed the lives of 19 children and two teachers. The President said he spent nearly four hours in a room with about 250 family members on Sunday. “The pain is palpable,” he said as he described his meetings with the community ahead of a meeting with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in the Oval Office. “Nobody left … until I spoke to every single person in that room. Every single person. They waited until the very end,” Biden added. She was going to be someone.  Families and friends remember the victims of the Uvalde school massacre as the first funerals are heldThe President said he and Ardern would be talking about violence and online extremism during their meeting. New Zealand voted on a bipartisan basis to change its gun laws after a live-streamed mass shooting in Christchurch in 2019, and Ardern has been at the forefront of efforts to crack down on online extremism.“I want to work with you on that effort and I want to talk to you about what those conversations were like, if you’re willing,” he told her.“Our experience of course, in this regard, is our own. But if there is anything that we can share of any value, we are here to share it,” she said later. Biden said he would be meeting with members of Congress on the possibility of gun reform as members are starting to meet to find a possible legislative answer to the tragedy in Uvalde. The President has acknowledged there is little he can do without the support of congressional Republicans to stop the mass shootings, which happen with alarming frequency in the US. “Much of it is preventable and the devastation is amazing,” Biden said on Tuesday. A small, bipartisan group of senators is meeting virtually Tuesday to explore potential areas of common ground on gun reform. Lawmakers are under intense pressure to take action in the aftermath of the horrific shooting, but there has been a stalemate over gun policy in Washington for years and Democratic efforts to reform gun laws have been repeatedly blocked by Republicans and some moderate members of their own party.Fresh developments over holiday weekend raise new questions about the failure of the law enforcement response in UvaldeSome of the measures Democrats have called for include expanded background check bills andred flag laws, which can allow law enforcement or family members to petition for a court order to temporarily take guns away from an individual deemed to be at significant risk of hurting themselves or others by having a firearm. Biden has also called for Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. The President and first lady on Sunday paid their respects at a makeshift memorial outside of Robb Elementary School. They also met with local officials, paramedics, mental health services providers, firefighters, and law enforcement officials. The Bidens also attended Mass at Sacred Heart Catholic Church, where Archbishop Gustavo García-Siller invited children from the devastated community to sit at the front.The Justice Department has announced it is conducting a reviewof the botched law enforcement response to theshooting, which Texas officials have described as punctuated with wrong decisions.CNN’s Morgan Rimmer and Clare Foran contributed to this report.

 Taco Bell’s Mexican Pizza is becoming increasingly hard to find just less than two weeks after it returned to menus.Demand for the beloved item was seven times higher than when it last appeared on menus two years ago, which has prompted many of its locations to sell out. For example, the company said one fan bought 180 Mexican Pizzas in a single order.“Because of the incredible love for the Mexican Pizza, we have begun selling out across the country,” Taco Bell said on its website. “Our restaurant teams trained weeks for what we knew would be a big return, we just didn’t realize how big, and replenishing the beloved menu item is taking longer than we’d like.”Taco Bell said in a statement that it’s working “diligently with our restaurants and suppliers” to get more ingredients for the pizza, and hopes it returns permanently to menus “by this fall.”The beloved menu item was eliminated in November 2020 as part of a broader culling of Taco Bell’s menu during the height of the pandemic. That helped Taco Bell shed complexities and costs. The Mexican Pizza consists of a tortilla shell filled with pizza sauce and either beans or ground beef. It’s topped with another tortilla shell that’s smothered with more sauce, cheese and chopped tomatoes. Taco Bell introduced the item in 1985 and originally called it the “Pizzazz Pizza.”Fast-food chains must constantly compete for customers’ dollars and attention, and specialty offerings are a way to try to cut through the noise. Taco Bell, in particular, regularly experiments with its menu by adding limited-time offers to stimulate customer interest.The brand is a strong performer for its parent company, Yum! Brands(YUM). It reported same-store sales growth of 5%, beating expectations, in its most recent earnings report. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

63,,"TGIF, right?No one likely is happier to see this week in the rearview mirror – more on that in a second – than North Carolina Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who has had a hellish last few days.Earlier this week, CNN reported that for the second time in the last five years, Cawthorn was facing charges of driving with a revoked license. And that that charge was one of three pending traffic citations against the congressman. (The other two were for speeding – one for going 89 miles per hour in a 65-mile-per-hour zone, the other for going 87 miles per hour in a 70 mile-per-hour zone.)Then, on Thursday, a video surfaced of a recent speech Cawthorn gave to supporters in which he described Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a “thug” and called the Ukrainian government “incredibly evil.” He also insisted, without explanation, that the Ukrainian government was “pushing woke ideologies.” Those comments – amid Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine – were decidedly counter to the general sentiment of support for Ukraine expressed by members of Congress and the American public. The remarks also immediately drew criticism from Cawthorn’s primary opponents – one of whom, state Sen. Chuck Edwards, tweeted this: “Let’s be clear. The thug is Vladimir Putin.”Cawthorn quickly moved to attempt to minimize the damage from his comments. “The actions of Putin and Russia are disgusting,” he tweeted. “But leaders, including Zelensky, should NOT push misinformation on America.” He didn’t specifically explain what misinformation Zelensky was allegedly pushing on America. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!Cawthorn has stirred controversy since 2020, when he won the House seat of former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, despite the fact that then President Donald Trump had endorsed one of his GOP primary opponents.Photos of a 2017 trip Cawthorn made to Adolf Hitler’s vacation house – prior to running for Congress – surfaced on Instagram. Cawthorn wrote that the visit has been on his “bucket list for awhile” and “did not disappoint.” In 2020, a website created for Cawthorn’s campaign alleged that New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker was aiming to “ruin white males running for office.” Booker said at the time: “It just really personally saddens me that somebody who is so clearly racist is a nominee of a major party, and I think it’s a disrespect of the entire community.” In the wake of the controversy, Cawthorn said that “the syntax of our language was unclear and unfairly implied I was criticizing Cory Booker.”In a Washington Post profile of Cawthorn that ran in February 2021, Michael Kranisch wrote:“The story of Cawthorn’s rise is, by any measure, an extraordinary accomplishment at a young age by a man who suffered a horrific injury. But an examination by The Post of how he ascended so quickly shows how even one of the most neophyte elected Republicans is adopting the Trump playbook, making false statements about his background, issuing baseless allegations about voter fraud and demonizing his political opponents.”The following month, CNN reported on the allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct made against Cawthorn by several women when he was in college. For his part, Cawthorn said that “I have never done anything sexually inappropriate in my life.”Which is, well, a lot. Especially when you consider that Cawthorn hasn’t even served a single full term in Congress. Controversy seems to follow him, which is rarely a good thing for an ambitious politician with big dreams. © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

66,,"Summer vacations, though fun and beneficial for mental clarity, have become unattainable for many Americans amid surging airfare and gas prices. About 61% of respondents in a recent poll said gas will be a major factor in their vacation plans this year. And with prices at the pump steadily rising, it’s no surprise that many people are postponing trips.(You can get “5 Things You Need to Know Today” delivered to your inbox daily.

In Philadelphia, three people died and 11 others were injured over the weekend after gunfire rang out at a popular entertainment district, officials said. Three others were killed and at least 14 were injured in a shooting in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Eight people were shot at a high school graduation party in Summerton, South Carolina, with one person killed. Several other shootings forced various law enforcement entities to remain on alert across the country. This comes as bipartisan talks on gun legislation are ongoing – but previous attempts in Congress to pass major gun regulation measures have either stalled or failed.Russian President Vladimir Putin is warning that Moscow will strike new targets if the US supplies long-range missiles to Ukraine. Delivering new arms to Kyiv would only “drag out the armed conflict for as long as possible,” Putin said yesterday. Meanwhile, Putin claims Russia’s actions in Ukraine “have nothing to do” with the looming global energy and food crisis, and has instead blamed Western economic policies. He also blamed European countries for not listening “to our urgent requests to preserve long-term contracts for the supply [of natural gas]” – another factor that he said led to inflation. In Ukraine, some of the “fiercest battles” are being fought in the eastern city of Severodonetsk, the region’s top official said today, adding that the evacuation of 15,000 civilians remains impossible because of intense fighting.Former President Donald Trump is mobilizing his MAGA allies to defend him ahead of the upcoming public hearings by the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. Trump’s team has asked some prominent Republicans to cover for him and push back on the committee while the public hearings play out, according to GOP sources familiar with the request. Committee members have teased that the prime-time hearings could be focused on Trump’s direct role in undermining the election results. The committee has been working toward a thesis that Trump’s obsession with losing the election and his peddling of false claims about the results is what laid the groundwork for the violent and deadly riot at the Capitol. The first public hearing will take place Thursday at 8 p.m. ET.The baby formula manufacturing plant that has been at the center of the nationwide shortage restarted production Saturday.

67,,"If you feel like calling it a day and dozing off for a bit, don’t feel bad – Monday is National Napping Day. It can be hard to find the time to rejuvenate and recover amid daily responsibilities, but napping has benefits that could help you level up in your overall health and productivity – meaning there’s no reason to feel as if you’re lazy for indulging in a little you-time. That’s if you’re not someone struggling with “coronasomnia,” a term some have given the inability to fall asleep or get good quality sleep during the coronavirus pandemic.An occasional nap can be healthy, but one longer than 45 minutes could interfere with your circadian rhythm – making falling asleep later that night more difficult. Here are five reasons why you should catch some zzz’s:If the lurching forward of the clock for Daylight Saving Time on Sunday made you noticeably more tired, you’re not the only one. This time change was actually the inspiration for National Napping Day, which takes place annually the day after the clocks move ahead.In 1999, the late William Anthony, a psychologist and Boston University professor, and his wife, Camille, instituted National Napping Day. Their intent was to overcome American cultural prejudice against napping and to raise awareness about the health benefits of catching up on quality sleep. “We figured this would be a good day to celebrate the importance of napping because everyone is one hour more sleep-deprived than usual,” Anthony said. “The fact is that the majority of Americans are sleep-deprived even without Daylight Saving Time.”Because of their efforts, some workplaces have observed the day with nap breaks. Thank you, Dr. Anthony. You can learn to put names to faces while you sleep, study findsA NASA-funded study on astronauts found that naps up to two and a half hours long improved working memory performance. Working memory involves focusing attention on one task while holding other tasks in memory, so a poor working memory could result in errors, according to a NASA news release.Taking a nap may make you more alert for the period right after you wake up and maybe hours into the day. A short snooze may also make you feel more relaxed.Taking a nap once or twice a week could lower the risk of heart attacks or strokes, according to a 2019 study published in the journal Heart. After tracking more than 3,400 people between the ages of 35 and 75 for slightly more than five years, the researchers found that those who indulged in occasional napping – once or twice a week, for five minutes to an hour – were 48% less likely to experience a heart attack, stroke or heart failure than those who didn’t nap at all. A recent study focusing on women found the more sleep-deprived the women were, the more likely they were to consume added sugar, fatty foods and caffeine. Struggling to quit sugar? You might not be sleeping enoughA lack of quality sleep could lead to overeating because inadequate sleep is believed to stimulate hunger and suppress hormone signals that communicate fullness. According to the researchers, the findings were important because women are at high risk for obesity and sleep disorders, which can both be driven by a high intake of food.Napping has been found to improve the overall quality of even nighttime sleep. The right side of your brain may experience a mental spark during a nap, research has suggested. The right side is the hemisphere most associated with creative tasks, like visualization and thinking, while the left is more analytic.Researchers monitoring the brain activity of 15 people found that the right side of their brain communicated busily with itself as well as with its left counterpart. The left side of the brain, on the other hand, remained relatively quiet. In a January 2020 study of 2,214 Chinese adults ages 60 and older, participants who took afternoon naps for five minutes to two hours showed better mental agility than those who didn’t nap. Napping may not ensure success in every aspect of your life, but it could improve your health and reboot your brain. Now go lie down.CNN’s Sandee LaMotte and Megan Marples contributed to this report.

68,,"When Jonathan Franks first heard that the American basketball star Brittney Griner had been detained in Russia, his initial sense was one of disbelief.But it wasn’t any kind of incredulity that she’d been arrested accused of possession of some cannabis oil at an airport near Moscow, more that any western media would relay the details of her alleged crime as if it was fact.“This is being reported as if people are taking these allegations seriously,” he told CNN.“I think that it’s a huge mistake to report these allegations as if they’re true or even are likely to be true.” Brittney Griner: Why so many WNBA stars play basketball overseasFranks was immediately suspicious, because he has worked on behalf of numerous American citizens who have unexpectedly found themselves in similar situations with hostile governments. He’s currently the campaign spokesman for Trevor Reed, who has been detained in Russia since August 2019.Based on the limited information that has been provided by the Russian Federal Customs Service and state media, Franks is very concerned about the predicament that Griner now finds herself to be in.“This has a lot of hallmarks of a very wrongful and arbitrary detention,” he explained. “I found the video from the Russian customs service odd. They’re parading her before cameras. The mugshot was completely unnecessary and asinine.”The Russian Customs Service claims that Griner was ‘smuggling significant amounts of narcotic substances’ and says that a criminal case is underway. A potential jail sentence of 10 years has been mentioned.“They’re making her out to sound like a drug kingpin. I think that it is unlikely that Ms. Griner will get a fair trial,” concludes Franks, “because nobody gets a fair trial in Russia. It’s a rigged game.”In 2014, the American Iranian journalist Jason Rezaian was detained in Tehran. He couldn’t have known it at the time, but he was in for a long stay at Iran’s notorious Evin Prison: 544 days.The Washington Post reporter was eventually released in January 2016, and in Griner’s case he sees many parallels to his own. “It’s the most audacious hostage taking by a state imaginable,” Rezaian told CNN.“I know from my own case that the supposed charges against me were not based in anything like reality, and they were used to perpetuate a narrative about why I was being held.”Like Franks, Rezaian cautions against repeating the allegations against Griner verbatim.“I think that every time reporters repeat that narrative, we’re doing some of the dirty work of the hostage takers for them. My attitude is Brittney Griner is innocent of any crimes until the world sees otherwise,” adds Rezaian.It’s still not exactly clear when Griner was apprehended in Russia, but it was some time in February, as she was returning from the States to compete for UMMC Ekaterinburg in the Russian basketball league.It’s Griner’s seventh season in Russia, where she plays during the off-season in North America. News of her predicament didn’t arrive in the US until March 5, when Russia revealed that they were holding her.Only then did Griner’s wife, Cherelle, begin writing about it on Instagram. “There are no words to express this pain,” she said. “I’m hurting, we’re hurting.”If she can indeed be classified as a ‘hostage,’ Griner will join an unenviable club of around more than 50 American citizens who are currently held hostage or wrongfully detained overseas.Campaigners have been working to free Americans Reed and Paul Whelan, who are both in Russia.Whilst acknowledging that Griner’s family have been placed under an enormous amount of emotional stress, Rezaian believes they should have spoken up sooner. “They made the same mistake that I see others making time and again, allowing the possible hostage taker to take control of the narrative,” says Rezaian.“Unfortunately, we see people telling themselves: ‘This is all just a big mistake that’s going to blow over in a few days.’ Suppressing her detention isn’t doing her any favors, these things don’t magically resolve themselves.”The timing of Griner’s detention could hardly be worse, she was arrested in the lead-up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and it was publicized only after the US had begun sanctioning the Russian government.“You can’t extricate these things from each other,” Rezaian explained. “To try and maintain diplomatic niceties around these situations may be in the interest of US national security, but it’s certainly not in the interest of Brittney Griner.”Rezaian urges Griner’s family to speak up and encourages her American employers to make some noise.Griner is a two-time Olympic champion, a seven-time all-star with the Phoenix Mercury and a legend of the women’s professional league, the WNBA. Whilst her team and the league have issued brief statements, Rezaian says they could and should be doing so much more.“The WNBA, a part of the NBA, one of the biggest and most powerful sports leagues in the whole world, has a real responsibility to this individual,” he says. “There should be a robust response.”In the vacuum of information about Griner’s situation, some have sought to fill the airwaves with commentary about her involvement with Russian basketball and the wisdom of her decision to travel there at a time when geo-political tensions in the region resembled a powder keg.It’s a sentiment that smacks of victim-blaming. “It’s irrelevant,” says Rezaian. “It’s not a credible argument.”Franks is equally dismissive. “Would have, could have, should have. It’s Monday morning quarterbacking, and it’s not helpful,” he says. “They have welcomed her to that country to work. To me, that’s pretty brazen.”Both men say that Griner had every right to continue working as a professional athlete in Russia, and the fact that a country in which she was well known and celebrated has now locked her up only makes the allegations against her more suspicious.Rezaian recalls the countless trips he made in and out of Iran over a period of five years. “I never had any problems until I did,| he says. “Is that my fault? No, absolutely not.” Colin Allred: US Representative says Brittney Griner case is  extremely concerning  ​and that her consular access ​has been blocked It’s hard for anybody to predict what the coming weeks and months will bring in Griner’s case, but Rezaian draws on his own experience to suggest that Griner might have to prepare for a long stay in Russia. “It may turn out to be a marathon, not a sprint. You hope that it’s a sprint but conserve your energy in a way that that will benefit you throughout this ordeal,” he says.In a podcast called ’544 Days,’ that he released in October 2021, Rezaian details the anxiety, uncertainty, and monotony of his detention in Iran. He says he made the audio series partly to lay out a roadmap to the families of other citizens that may one day find themselves in a similar situation.“I tried to find things to laugh at every day because there’s certainly a lot of absurdity in these situations,” he adds.“That doesn’t take away from the horror and the terror of it, but the absurdity that a great American athlete is being held on unsubstantiated charges at the dawn of a cataclysmic war on the other side of the world? It is horrifying, but it’s also farcical in its own way.”Franks knows from his time of advocating for Reed that Griner could be detained for a while. He urges everybody that cares about her to keep her case in the public arena.“Sports fans can play a huge role because they’re not a constituency that I think the [American] government is hearing from,” says Franks.“You want to see Brittney Griner come home? Or Trevor Reed or Paul Whelan or any of the other 50 hostages? I would suggest calling the White House every day and telling them you want President Biden to prioritize the repatriation of wrongfully detained American citizens.”Franks reiterates that Griner’s family should do the same. “There’s a difficult choice to make about whether to speak or not to but shine a light,” he says. “If it were my loved one, my answer would be shine a light. Every time.“People that do wrongful detention are oddly sensitive to bad headlines.” © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

69,,"While dismantling the pedestal that once held aJefferson Davisstatuein Richmond, Virginia, workerson Wednesdaydiscovered a box encased in stone, the city said.“Until we see what’s inside, it’s just a box, but most historians believe it is a time capsule,” James Nolan, the mayor’s press secretary wrote to CNN on Friday.Protesters tore down and vandalized the statue of the president of the Confederacy in June 2020, but the pedestal remained. Many statues of Confederate leaders came down that summer in cities across the US as widespread protests denounced racism and oppression.Virginia protesters tear down a statue of Jefferson Davis a day after bringing down Christopher ColumbusRichmond began removing and transporting the pedestals that formerly held Confederate monuments on February 1, according to a city news release.The box is being stored in a secure location by the city until the Black History Museum and Cultural Center of Virginia figures out what to do with it, Nolan said.The Richmond City Council passed a resolution on January 24 to transfer ownership of all Confederate monuments, pedestals and related artifacts to the Black History Museum. The museum is partnering with the Valentine, another museum, to determine what to do with these objects.CNN reached out to the Black History Museum about the plans for the box and has not heard back.“Our institution takes very seriously the responsibility to manage these objects in ways that ensure their origins and purpose are never forgotten: that is the glorification of those who led the fight to enslave African Americans and destroy the Union,” Marland Buckner, interim executive director of the Black History Museum and Cultural Center of Virginia, said in a city news release from December 30.“We hope this process will elevate public dialog about our shared history and in so doing encourage and invite more citizens into fact-based, respectful conversations about the profound challenges we face as a nation,” he said. An 1875 almanac, books and a coin were discovered in time capsule found in the pedestal of Robert E. Lee statueOther monuments entrusted to the museums include those of Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, J.E.B. Stuart and more, according to the news release.This isn’t the first box to be discovered beneath a Confederate monument in Richmond. In December, two time capsules were found buried under the pedestal of the Robert E. Lee statue. Lee was a Confederate general.The first time capsule included an 1875 almanac, two old books, a coin and a cloth envelope, which historians believe was buried in 1887. A week later, a Bible with a coin stuck to it and an 1865 edition of Harper’s Weekly magazine with an image of a figure weeping over President Abraham Lincoln’s grave were found in the second time capsule. © 2023 Cable News Network.

 An abandoned cargo ship packed with cars is adrift in the Atlantic Ocean, after a rapidly-spreading fire on board forced the crew to escape.The 656 foot-long Felicity Ace roll-on/roll-off car-carrying ship caught fire in the North Atlantic on Wednesday as it carried cargo, including Porsches and Volkswagens, from Emden, Germany to Davisville, Rhode Island. At the time of the fire’s outbreak, the ship was sailing 90 nautical miles southwest of Portugal’s Azores, according to a statement on Wednesday by the Portuguese Navy. After the fire broke out in the cargo hold, it spread and forced all 22 crew members to abandon ship. According to another statement by the Portuguese Navy, the crew was safely picked up and taken to a local hotel, with the rescue coordinated by the Ponta Delgada Maritime Search and Rescue Coordination Center. There has been no noticeable source of pollution from the fire, according to the statement.The ship’s owners have arranged for a tow as it continues to burn. Registered to Panama, the Felicity Alice is operated by Japanese shipping line Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL). MOL has not responded to request for comment. Porsche confirmed to CNN Business that a number of its cars were among the cargo and that customers with cars on board the burning ship are being contacted by their dealers. “While it remains too early to confirm what occurred and next steps, we are – along with our colleagues at Porsche AG – supporting our customers and our dealers as best we can to find solutions,” said Angus Fitton, Vice President of PR at Porsche Cars North America. “We are in contact with the shipping company and the details of the cars on board are now known.” Expectant Porsche owners with cars on board like journalist and host Matt Farah, who said he had a 2022 Porsche Boxster Spyder awaiting delivery, have already started receiving word from dealerships about the status of their vehicles.“The dealer confirmed that my car, along with at least a dozen other vehicles they were expecting, is on that boat,” Farah said. “They had no further information for me beyond confirming my car was on the boat, and said that as soon as Porsche Cars North America has a plan of any kind with how to proceed, that they would share the plans with me.”Volkswagen also has customers awaiting vehicles on the burning cargo ship. “We are aware of an incident involving a third-party cargo ship transporting Volkswagen Group vehicles across the Atlantic. The vessel was on its way to North America,” said Dirk Ameer, a Volkswagen spokesperson. “At this time, we are not aware of any injuries. We are in contact with the shipping company to get more information about the incident.”The Felicity Ace can carry over 17,000 metric tons of cargo, according to the Associated Press, with possibly thousands of cars on board . The Portugese Navy said that as of Thursday, the fire is ongoing, and an ocean patrol vessel remains on site to monitor the abandoned ship.Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

71,,"A delegation of Ukrainian lawmakers visiting Washington, DC, on Wednesday said they believe Russia is just using peace talks with Ukraine as a “smokescreen” for their forces to regroup and re-strategize in Ukraine. “At this particular moment, these peace negotiations are far from real negotiations,” Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, who chairs Ukraine’s Parliamentary Committee on Integration of Ukraine to the European Union, told a small group of reporters at a roundtable hosted by the German Marshall Fund think tank.“Definitely, I think that Putin is using this as a smokescreen, buying time to regroup … and sending false, lying messages to the whole world,” she said.“We feel these are not real peace talks at this point,” said MP Anastasia Radina, who heads the parliament’s Committee on Anti-Corruption Policy. “We feel that what Russia is doing is trying to save face. They say they are withdrawing troops from Kiev region. That’s not true for one simple reason. They’re not withdrawing. … They were kicked (out).” Radina said there is only “one way out of the war, and that is for Ukraine to win.”Their remarks came one day after the Russian Ministry of Defense said that it had decided to “drastically reduce hostilities” around Kyiv and Chernihiv. US officials, including President Joe Biden, remain skeptical of the announcement.“We’ll see,” Biden said on Tuesday when asked about Russia’s claims. “I don’t read anything into it until I see what their actions are. We’ll see if they follow through on what they’re suggesting.”Ukraine’s military is seeking foreign assistance obtaining reconnaissance and attack drones, tactical radars, electronic warfare anti-drone systems and close-air support aircraft, according to Ukraine’s most recent list of needs provided to Congress. The list delivered to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, which was obtained by CNN, also includes help treating wounded troops and repairing equipment, including mobile military medical hospitals, the repairs of armored vehicles in neighboring countries and aircraft to help transport weapons. Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat, said at a House Armed Services Committee hearing on Wednesday that latest the list provided to Congress this week reflected Ukrainian military and civilian leadership’s “urgent needs.” At the top of the priority list of 17 items was reconnaissance and attack drones, including “switchblade” drones, which are small so-called kamikaze or suicide drones that carry a warhead and detonate on impact.The list also included combat aircraft – specifically referencing the Su-25, a Russian-made ground attack plane similar to the US-made A-10 Warthog. The Ukrainian military is also seeking artillery systems, surface-to-air missile systems, anti-tank Javelin missiles, anti-ship missiles and optical surveillance equipment.The all-female Ukrainian delegation – men between the ages of 18-60 are not allowed to leave Ukraine amid the war – traveled to Washington this week primarily, they say, to ask American lawmakers and administration officials for more military support, which they said is still falling far short of Ukraine’s needs.“Proper action for Ukraine right now, for support to Ukraine right now, would be weaponry,” Radina said. “Ukraine is constantly asking for weaponry and not only defensive weaponry, but also offensive weaponry. In our situation, this distinction between defensive and offensive is, frankly speaking, humiliating. In our situation, all weapons are defensive because we are defending our lands.”Radina reiterated that Ukraine needs fighter jets, “because this is how we can actually stop bombings. … And as of now this is the issue on the table, and while it is on the table, people will continue suffering.”“Our ‘humanitarian aid’ is weapons,” said MP Maria Ionova. “Because to minimize these victims and casualties, we have to defend our air. Freedom has to be armed. And that is why our main message here is please, help us to defend our future and the future of the democratic world.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has signaled that Ukraine might be willing to forgo NATO membership and commit to neutrality if the West provides Ukraine with solid security guarantees. But such a move would have to be put to a referendum – and Klympush-Tsintsadze indicated that anything short of NATO membership should be rejected. “Neutrality is not an option for Ukraine,” she said. “I want everybody to understand we were non-aligned. We were a non-bloc country back in 2014. It did not preclude Putin from attacking us at that point. And it did not preclude him from grabbing part of our territory. So it will not stop him. Even if we write on all the papers, all over, that we are neutral. He just is not interested in us existing as such.”Radina echoed those comments, saying that “absolute neutrality is not an option for Ukraine,” because Russia will always border the country and aim to “obliterate” Ukraine from the map.“So yes, we are looking for workable security guarantees and not just another Budapest Memorandum,” she said.The UK, US, and Russia signed that memorandum – which was supposed to prohibit those countries from using military force against Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan – in exchange for them giving up their nuclear weapons.Zelensky told the Munich Security Conference last month that Ukraine “has tried three times” since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, “to convene consultations with the guarantor states of the Budapest Memorandum. Three times without success.”CNN’s Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/30/politics/ukraine-parliament-russia-skepticism/index.html
72,,"Some 130 people have been killed and more than 3,000 have been forcibly displaced this year as violence has surged in eastern Colombia, according to the United Nations and the Catholic Church.The institutions have called on armed groups to stop the violence and respect international humanitarian law in a joint statement published Wednesday, after officials visited the Colombian region of Arauca, which borders Venezuela.“During the visit, the representatives met with authorities, civil society and human rights organizations, and expressed solidarity with the communities, victims, civil society organisations and institutions suffering from the situation of violence in the region,” the statement said.Fighting erupted between the National Liberation Army – the largest leftist guerrilla group in the country, known by its Spanish acronym ELN – and dissident factions of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, in the early hours of January 2, according to Colombia’s ombudsman Carlos Camargo.More than 20 people were killed in those clashes, according to a spokesperson from Colombia’s Attorney General’s Office. Colombia struck a peace deal with guerrilla groups years ago. So why is violence surging?Human Rights Watch (HRW) echoed the UN and Catholic Church’s claims in a separate report released on Monday, saying fighting between ELN and dissident FARC forces in early 2022 had caused thousands to flee a “dramatic increase in violence” on the Colombia-Venezuela border.HRW also accused Venezuelan armed forces of conducting joint operations with ELN guerrilla fighters against FARC dissidents in the border area in early 2022, contributing to the violence in the region.The HRW report is based on interviews with more than 100 eyewitnesses and alleged victims.“These testimonies show that the cooperation between the ELN and the Venezuelan security forces goes much further than previously reported,” Juan Pappier, HRW’s senior Americas researcher, and one of the authors of the report, said.“Members of the Venezuelan forces are not just being tolerant to ELN abuses, they are participating in joint military operations where the guerrillas do the ‘dirty work’,” Pappier told CNN. CNN has reached out to the Venezuelan Ministry of Defense for comment.FARC and ELN started fighting each other in Arauca and the neighboring Venezuelan state of Apure in 2006. The fighting stopped in 2010, at which point at least 868 people had been killed and 58,000 people had been displaced, according to a 2020 HRW report.However this year has seen an uptick in violence as the groups compete for control of lucrative drug smuggling routes to the US and Europe. The renewed violence comes more than five years after the Colombian government signed a peace agreement with FARC, ending a 52-year armed conflict that killed up to 220,000 people and displaced as many as 5 million people.Colombian President Ivan Duque vowed to stamp out the violence during his time in office, but it continues to plague rural areas, where peace was supposed to bring development and new opportunities.Voters will choose a new president during elections scheduled for May, and many candidates have vowed to undo Duque’s policies by changing Colombia’s approach toward security. © 2023 Cable News Network.

73,,"The “Hurricane Hunters” Air Force unit that flies specially equipped aircraft directly into severe weather has opened an investigation after one of its training flights landed at Martha’s Vineyard to pick up a motorcycle belonging to one of the crew members, according to a statement from the 403rd Wing.

74,,"Businessman Mike Gibbons has gained ground in Ohio’s competitive Republican primary for the state’s open US Senate seat. And like some of his rivals, Gibbons has been making wildly inaccurate claims about the 2020 election.At a debate on March 18, Gibbons said, “I know this: Five million more people voted than were registered to vote. There’s something wrong.”At a debate on March 21, Gibbons repeated his claim about five million more people voting than were registered to vote, and he added that his numbers came “from the US Census Bureau.” He reiterated this claim at another debate, on Monday: “Five million more people voted than were registered to vote, and that’s according to the US Census Bureau. There’s a problem. We need to investigate it. The January 6 commission should be investigating that instead of some false accusation of some kind of insurrection.” Facts First: It’s not even close to true that five million more people voted in the 2020 election than were registered to vote, and the Census Bureau never said such a thing. There were actually about 48 million fewer voters in the 2020 election than there were active registered voters, according to the official post-election report of the US Election Assistance Commission, a federal entity that collects election data from states. In other words, per the commission’s findings, Gibbons’ claim was off by about 53 million.The Election Assistance Commission wrote in the report that “more than 209 million people were active registered voters for the 2020 general election, which represents an all-time high, and more than 161 million voters cast ballots that were counted for this election.”Census Bureau data also contradicts Gibbons’ claim. The bureau’s election figures are imprecise estimates since they are derived from a survey of a sample of the US population rather than from official election records. But they still don’t show what Gibbons says they show. The Census Bureau reported that significantly more people were registered to vote in 2020 (an estimated 168.3 million) than actually voted (an estimated 154.6 million).Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political science professor who studies elections, said Tuesday: “It is absolutely ludicrous to say that more people voted than there are registered voters.” He described Gibbons’ comments as “wild claims to appease people who want to believe that somehow there was fraud that denied (former President Donald Trump) the election.”Similar false claims about there being more votes cast than registered voters in the 2020 election have circulated online since late 2020. A Gibbons campaign spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday and Wednesday. For this election-focused fact check, we’ll leave aside Gibbons’ assertion that it’s incorrect to say there was “some kind of insurrection” at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.At the debates on March 18 and Monday, Gibbons followed up his false claim about registration numbers in 2020 with a false claim about what happened in 2020 in the swing state of Wisconsin, which was won by now-President Joe Biden. He said on March 18: “I don’t know if you just saw the Wisconsin evidence, but apparently there are a number of nursing homes where 103% of the nursing home occupants voted – and they all voted for Joe Biden.” He said on Monday: “Recently, there was a Wisconsin special counsel that discovered that a great – good – number of nursing homes in Wisconsin voted at 103% of their occupancy. And they all voted for Joe Biden.” Facts First: The Wisconsin special counsel report Gibbons was referring to – a Republican-initiated partisan review conducted by Michael Gableman, a conservative former Wisconsin Supreme Court justice – did not say that all of the residents at any Wisconsin nursing home voted for Biden. The special counsel did not even look into the question of which candidates Wisconsin nursing home residents selected, a spokesperson for Gableman’s office, Zakory Niemierowicz, told CNN on Tuesday.“We did not do anything with who the residents voted for,” Niemierowicz said.Gableman’s report features a strong suggestion that Wisconsin could lawfully decertify the 2020 election, which, in reality, is impossible – as his own attorney told legislators.The report’s section on nursing homes is also dubious. It alleges that there was a “100% voting rate” at dozens of nursing homes supposedly “vetted” by Gableman’s team. But this claim has been called inaccurate by local elections officials and by journalists who looked into the numbers.To take just one example, Gableman’s report claimed that 100% of registered voters cast ballots at 24 “vetted” nursing homes in Dane County. But Wisconsin State Journal reporter Chris Rickert found that records showed there was only one nursing home in the county – a facility with 12 registered voters – where every registered voter had a ballot counted in the 2020 election. Turnout at every other nursing home in the county “ranged from 42% to 91%,” Rickert wrote – and those, he said, are the inflated percentages you get if you compare actual voters to registered voters, as Gableman claimed to be doing, rather than comparing actual voters to voting-age residents, as is standard in turnout calculations.Niemierowicz said Tuesday that the special counsel’s office stands by the nursing home numbers in the report. But Niemierowicz gave CNN a different explanation of its nursing home calculations than the explanation that appears in the report. He said the special counsel was comparing the number of voters at nursing homes to the number of total beds these nursing homes said they had, not to the number of “registered voters” in those nursing homes – though the report says “registered voters.” “We should’ve probably had different headers on that table,” Niemierowicz said.But changing the table headings wouldn’t have solved the puzzle of Gableman’s nursing home numbers. When CNN compared voters to beds using Milwaukee County figures Niemierowicz provided on Tuesday, the result was about 43%, not 100%.“None of this surprises me,” Claire Woodall-Vogg, executive director of the City of Milwaukee Election Commission, said in an email Tuesday. “Little of the investigation that has been presented so far has been supported by facts.”Gibbons was far from the only candidate at the debate on Monday to make a false claim about the 2020 election. With the exception of state Sen. Matt Dolan, who correctly says Biden was legitimately elected, candidates in the Republican primary have competed for months over who can sound the most aggressive in challenging the legitimacy of Biden’s victory and in demanding “election integrity.”On Monday, former Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel repeated his usual false claim that the election was “stolen from Donald J. Trump,” baselessly casting aspersions on the results in some heavily Democratic cities. Businessman Mark Pukita and author J.D. Vance also proclaimed the election stolen from Trump. Businessman Neil Patel made a vague false claim about tens of thousands of invalid ballots in Georgia.Former Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken did not say the election was stolen but said, “There’s no doubt in my mind there were irregularities and fraud in the 2020 election.” © 2023 Cable News Network.

76,,"The trial of an ISIS fighter accused of assisting in the kidnapping, torture and death of several Americans, Europeans and other foreign nationals from 2012 to 2015 began Tuesday in Alexandria, Virginia, with opening statements from each side.El Shafee Elsheikh, raised in London, is accused of being a member of a group of ISIS militants – dubbed the “Beatles” by their hostages because of their British accents – who, according to court documents, traveled from England to Syria in 2012 and joined the terrorist organization.According to prosecutors, Elsheikh helped take hostages in order to demand the release of ISIS militants in prison or to collect ransom. While some were released, many of the hostages were killed by the group on camera for propaganda films.Elsheikh, the last alleged member of the terror cell to face trial, has been charged with hostage-taking that resulted in the death of four Americans: journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig. Elsheikh’s co-defendant, Alexanda Kotey, pleaded guilty in September.Another member of the terror cell, Mohamed Emwazi, who prosecutors say was responsible for many of the beheadings of hostages, was killed in a drone strike in 2015.During their opening statement, prosecutors outlined the allegations against Elsheikh, foreshadowing the evidence they would present to the jury over the three-to-four-week trial, including interviews with Elsheikh in which they say he confessed to being part of the “Beatles” terror cell, took part in beatings and organized communications with the hostage’s families.“This is a case about the captivity in Syria of four Americans,” assistant US attorney John Gibbs said Tuesday, telling jury members that they would hear “horrific testimony” about the hostages’ treatment and their ultimate death.Gibbs told the jury that Elsheikh was captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces in 2018 and was identified after US officials took his fingerprints and ran them through a Department of Justice database. During his time in SDF custody, the FBI as well as media outlets interviewed Elsheikh about his time as an ISIS militant and his role with the hostages.“He described his role in getting email addresses” for the families, Gibbs said, adding that Elsheikh also said he would partake in the beatings of hostages.According to prosecutors, the Americans and at least 16 other Western hostages were moved and spread out over at least nine different makeshift prisons throughout Syria, where they were beaten, tortured and, in some cases, eventually murdered.Gibbs described the brutal decapitations of Foley, Sotloff and Kassig – filmed by the terror group – which the government is set to show the jury images of later in the trial. According to Gibbs, Mueller was taken hostage in August 2013 as a slave for ISIS and was repeatedly raped by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi before she died in what ISIS claims was a Jordanian airstrike.In his comparatively short opening statement, Edward MacMahon, one of Elsheikh’s attorneys, told the jury that while the crimes are “beyond heart breaking and horrific,” Elsheikh was not a member of the “Beatles” terror cell but a “simple ISIS fighter.”The evidence is “inconsistent at best,” MacMahon said, adding that witness testimony from other hostages of the terror cell will have different versions “of which Beatle is which.” According to MacMahon, Elsheikh traveled to Syria to help the people suffering under President Bashar al-Assad and was trying to protect himself and his family when being interviewed by the US government and media outlets.Family members of the victims were present in the courtroom Tuesday, including Foley’s parents and Bethany Haines, the daughter of David Haines – a British aid worker killed by the group. Bethany Haines and Foley’s mother, Diane, along with several other members of the victim’s families, took notes throughout the opening statements, sitting still and attentive as each side outlined the forthcoming case.Elsheikh was also in the courtroom, dressed in a blue, button-down shirt and black glasses, with a mask covering his mouth and part of his beard.During the trial, the Department of Justice will show the jury propaganda films from ISIS, photos of the deceased victims, letters, email correspondences between families of the victims and ISIS, as well as bring witnesses who were also hostages of the group to testify. One of the witnesses set to testify is a Kurdish woman who was enslaved by ISIS with Mueller.T.S.

 Lululemon unveiled a new product Tuesday that speaks to the upscale brand’s ambition to expand into new categories.The athleisure company, known for its leggings and yoga pants, introduced a running shoe for women called Blissfeel. The shoe marks Lululemon first-ever foray into footwear. Your toilet paper roll is slimming downThe move sets Lululemon(LULU) Athletica up as the newest entrant in the fast-growing, highly competitive athletic footwear market, which saw annual sales grow 20% in 2021 over the prior year as consumers gravitated to more casual dressing during the pandemic, according to market research firm NPD.The company said its Blissfeel shoes will be available for purchase beginning March 22 in select stores across North America, China, the United Kingdom and online.The sneaker, priced at $148, is made with foam cushion technology and comes in 10 colors, the company said. Lululemon said the footwear is designed to focus on the unmet needs of active women.“We intentionally started with women because we saw an opportunity to solve for the fact that, more often than not, performance shoes are designed for men and then adapted for women,” Sun Choe, Lululemon’s chief product officer, said in a statement. “That didn’t sit well with us.” Pickleball, virtual golf, skydiving, craft beer: How malls are luring shoppers The brand is rolling out three additional footwear options for women this year that include a cross-training shoe, a training shoe and what it’s calling a “post-workout” shoe. “This is a big deal,” said NPD’s senior industry advisor and footwear analyst Matt Powell. “This is the first time a major brand is making a sneaker specifically for women. Basically what the brands sell in this space are smaller versions of men’s shoes. This is a dirty little secret of the industry. Lululemon is building a shoe from the inside out uniquely designed for women’s feet.”The company said a separate footwear line for men will debut next year.Lululemon signaled its intention to expand into footwear in 2019, when company executives said during an analyst event that they saw “white space” in the category that they hoped to take advantage of. The move now pits Lululemon against industry leaders Nike(NKE) and Adidas as well as trendier brands such as On and Allbirds.“On the surface, making this play in sneakers is sensible as it’s a massive market and one which naturally complements Lululemon’s other athleisure products,” said Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail.“That said, people are very wedded to brands like Nike, so Lulu is going to have to differentiate strongly if it wants to make an impact,” he added.

79,,"Marvel is changing the name and design of a character that debuted in a recent issue of the comic miniseries “King Conan” after it was criticized for its portrayal of an Indigenous woman.The third issue of “King Conan,” published on February 16, finds its protagonist stranded on a island with a scantily clad princess named Matoaka. The princess, as it turns out, has a dark past: She hails from “a land far to the west,” and once fell in love with a man who tried to colonize her people. When the man ransacked her home, she killed him, but her father nonetheless exiled her to the island, where she’s now cursed to lure other would-be colonizers away from her native land.To people in Indian Country, Matoaka’s name and backstory were a clear reference to the real-life Pocahontas, who privately went by the same name. For centuries, Pocahantas has been romanticized and mythologized as a woman who defied her father to save the English colonist John Smith from execution. In reality, she was around 11 or 12 when she first met Smith, and historians have disputed Smith’s claims that she rescued him at all. Later, she was kidnapped by the English and raped in captivity, according to the Mattaponi tribe’s oral history. Given that history, some Indigenous comic book artists and fans found the character in “King Conan” – and the hypersexualized way she was depicted – to be demeaning and disrespectful.“The real Matoaka was a pre-teen girl who suffered at the hands of her English captors,” Arigon Starr, a comic book artist who is an enrolled member of the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma, wrote in an email to CNN. “What’s even more shocking is that most of this information is online; a quick search would have informed the writer, artist, editor and publisher that it was a poor choice to give this character the name of a famous victim of violence.”Kayla Shaggy, a Two-Spirit comic book artist who is Diné and Anishinabe, said she felt that the character reduced Indigenous women to an offensive stereotype.“The fact that they depict an Indigenous woman as this nubile prize to be won by non-natives in stereotypical, fetish-y clothing contributes to the current, ongoing harm and ignorance of missing and murdered Indigenous women,” she wrote to CNN.In light of the criticism, writer Jason Aaron apologized for the character, calling his decision to use the name Matoaka “ill-considered.”“This new character is a supernatural, thousand-year-old princess of a cursed island within a world of pastiche and dark fantasy and was never intended to be based on anyone from history,” he said in a statement shared by Marvel. “I should have better understood the name’s true meaning and resonance and recognized it wasn’t appropriate to use it. I understand the outrage expressed by those who hold the true Matoaka’s legacy dear, and for all of this and the distress it’s caused, I apologize.”Aaron added that he had donated the money he made from the issue to the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center. A spokesperson for Marvel said that Matoaka’s name and appearance would be changed in future printings, upcoming issues and digital editions, though the details were still being finalized.Still, Shaggy was disappointed that the company didn’t pull the issue from stands and halt distribution altogether.“The character is still an Indigenous stereotype, her story is a rehash of racist narratives, and overall continuing the story still puts money in the company’s pocket at the expense of native people,” she said.Native Americans have long been marginalized and misrepresented in comic books, “from the bloodthirsty barbarians and noble savages of dime novels, to formulaic secondary characters and sidekicks” as Michael Sheyahshe explored in his book “Native Americans in Comic Books: A Critical Study.”“To paraphrase from Michael’s work – Native people have been relegated to the sidekick, shaman, overly sexualized or super tracker characters,” Starr said. “We are rarely the main character or the hero.”In recent years, however, projects helmed by Native artists and writers have provided more authentic representation in the comic book world. Starr and Shaggy said they hoped the “King Conan” controversy would result in more opportunities for Indigenous creators in the industry.“The support for authentic Native characters and comics is out there,” Starr added. “Maybe one day, Marvel and DC will catch up to us.” © 2023 Cable News Network.

 At its first product event of the year on Tuesday, Apple unveiled an upgraded iPad Air, a new desktop computer and a powerful new Mac chip. But the standout product was a new budget iPhone with access to 5G networks. Apple’s new iPhone SE, only the third version since the model launched in 2017, runs on the company’s faster A15 Bionic chip, the same in-house processor that drives the iPhone 13 line. It also features an updated camera and a longer-lasting battery, packed into the same 4.7-inch display as the previous model. But it’s the added 5G capability that could be the ultimate draw for customers, by giving them access to the faster wireless network at a more affordable price point. However, the bump up to 5G comes with a price change. The device will cost $429 — $30 more than the previous model. When Apple released its second version of the iPhone SE in April 2020, the budget smartphone seemed well-suited for the moment. The global pandemic was in its early days. Millions of households were grappling with job loss and financial uncertainty. And consumers were largely stuck at home, with less use for some of the bells and whistles that come with higher-end smartphones. “Consumers were uncertain about the outlook and an affordable iPhone was ideally placed to take advantage of that,” said Ben Wood, an analyst with market research firm CCS Insight. “In 2022 things have improved but the iPhone SE franchise still fills an important role as an affordable iPhone for consumers still cautious about splashing out on a top-of-the-line iPhone or who just don’t feel the need to spend more than is necessary.”For Apple, the new SE offers the promise to further boost demand for its core smartphone business by luring away Android users and convincing more iPhone owners to upgrade. In January, Apple reported record revenue during the all-important holiday quarter fueled in part by demand for its latest lineup of iPhones. Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said there is “pent up demand for this next SE” globally. In an analyst note after the event Tuesday, Ives said the new SE “will be the fastest and most powerful phone at these price points by a wide margin.”Colors for the new SE include midnight (black), starlight (white) and red. Pre-orders start today and the device starts shipping on March 18. Separately, Apple announced it would add two new shades of green to its iPhone 13 lineup: The iPhone 13 will now be available in a bold new green and the iPhone 13 Pro will come in an alpine green.Here’s a closer look at what else Apple announced at its virtual event on Tuesday:Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the “new, even more amazing, iPad Air,” which features its M1 chip, the same in-house processor used in the iPad Pro, as well as 5G capabilities and a revamped front-facing camera.The new iPad Air is available for pre-order starting Friday and will be available in stores on March 18. The price starts at $599.Apple’s in-house M1 chips have improved the speed and performance of its devices. Now, the company is adding a new chip, the M1 Ultra, to the lineup. The latest processor joins its existing family of chips, including the M1, M1 Pro and M1 Max.The M1 Ultra will make some Mac desktops faster, more powerful and more power efficient. It has 114 million transistors (seven times more than the M1), 128 GB of unified memory for big workloads, and is nearly eight times faster than the M1. Apple unveiled new desktop computers –the Mac Studio and Studio Display – that will use its M1 Max and M1 Ultra chips.Thanks to Apple’s in-house chips, the Mac Studio has a strikingly small form factor — just 7.7 inches by 3.7 inches. It will also be quieter, faster and more energy efficient than other high-end Macs. The Mac Studio with the M1 Ultra is expected to be 90% faster than the company’s powerful 16-core Mac Pro. Meanwhile, the Mac Studio with M1 Max will have up to 64 GB of unified memory, and the M1 Ultra will have up to 128 GB of memory. The Mac Studio comes with four thunderbolt ports, two USB-A ports, ethernet and HDMI ports and a pro audio jack on the back. The front of the device will feature an SD card reader and either USB-C or thunderbolt ports on the front, depending on the model. The Studio Display comes with a 27-inch screen and a 5K retina display. It also boasts a 12 megapixel camera that supports Apple’s Center Stage feature for improved video calls, as well as spatial audio capabilities. The Mac Studio with M1 Max will start at $1,999 and the device with the M1 Ultra will start at $3,999. The Mac Studio Display will start at $1,599. The line is now available for pre-orders and will be available March 18. Cook kicked off the event by previewing some new content coming to Apple TV+ later this year and reviewed some of its existing popular content, including the film Coda, which has been nominated for the Oscar in Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor. Friday night baseball is also coming to Apple TV+. Each Friday, two Major League Baseball games will be streamed exclusively on Apple TV+, Cook said.Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

All can be pre-ordered today, and will be available March 18. From CNN Business  Catherine Thorbecke For nearly an hour on Tuesday, Apple executives ticked off a long list of product updates, but they never acknowledged the difficult backdrop for the event: the war in Ukraine.Russia s invasion of Ukraine has put public pressure on the tech sector and business community in general to take action. Apple s decision to proceed with its event amid the conflict also received some pushback on social media.CEO Tim Cook has been known to reference major news during Apple events, but he stayed silent on the conflict Tuesday. As one tech journalist from the Wall Street Journal pointed out on Twitter, however, Cook appeared to be wearing a blue shirt with a yellow Apple Watch band -- the colors of Ukraine s national flag. Last week, Apple said it was taking some steps in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine -- such as suspending sales in Russia and barring state-run RT News and Sputnik News from being downloaded on its App Store outside of Russia. Ukrainian officials, however, have urged Cook and Apple to do more.From CNN Business  Catherine ThorbeckeApple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the “new, even more amazing, iPad Air” at Tuesday’s event.

The device will cost $429 — $30 more than the previous model. Along with 5G accessibility, Apple’s A15 processor is a big addition. It s the same chip found in its higher-end iPhone 13 models. The overall design, however, remains the same, including the home button with Touch ID. The company also showed off several graphics comparing the 4.7-inch SE to the iPhone 8 model, likely in a bid to get people who haven’t upgraded in awhile to do so. Colors include midnight (black), starlight (white) and red.

But the real headline grabber will be 5G.Who s it for? Although the SE line launched in 2017 -- and was updated in 2020 -- the third iteration could be the ultimate draw for customers by giving them access to faster 5G wireless networks at a more affordable price point ($399).

83,,"Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said he continues to work with his Republican and Democratic colleagues to pass gun safety legislation, especially after the deadly school shooting last week in Michigan.“The fact of matter is we have the votes in the House, in the Senate, for universal background checks bill. We have a President who will sign it,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” “It’s the rules of the Senate that prevent us from passing and we probably have 52, 53, 54 votes in the Senate for this. So the rules right now are what prevents us from being able to enact the will of the public.” School district releases details of key events leading up to Michigan shootingHe added he was hopeful senators can resume negotiations on legislation that would close the gun show loophole.“I wish my Republican colleagues didn’t sort of have epiphanies on this issue only after mass school shootings, but that tends to be what happens,” he said. “And so my hope is that in the next couple of weeks we can get back to the table and see if we can, at the very least, as you said, maybe close the gun show loophole. That alone would save a lot of lives.”He also said he believes a safe storage policy for guns could be a bipartisan solution for gun safety policy.“A safe storage law may be the kind of thing that could draw bipartisan compromise that could get support of a lot of common-sense gun owners because it’s not about taking anybody’s weapons away. It’s just about saying, if you’re going to own the weapon, store it safely,” he said.Earlier Sunday, Michigan Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee told CNN’s Boris Sanchez that he’s spoken with President Joe Biden about the need for action on gun control and implored his colleagues in the Senate to take action.“The real question is not where the White House stands, not where the House of Representatives stands, but whether we’re going to continue to allow a handful of senators to stand in the way of preventing further violence,” he said. “So far, they haven’t been moved.” © 2023 Cable News Network.

 Smaller American companies are getting crushed in the stock market’s recent wild swings. That could be an ominous sign for the economy.The Russell 2000(RUT) index, home to companies like Crocs(CROX), BJ’s Wholesale(BJ) and others with an average market valuation of about $3 billion, is now trading more than 10% below its 52-week high. That means it’s in a so-called correction. An iShares exchange-traded fund of microcap stocks(IWC) (which are even tinier firms than those in the Russell 2000) is nearly 15% below its peak. So it’s potentially heading into a bear market.This is troubling because most smaller US firms depend more on the American economy (and US consumers) for their revenue and earnings than the giants of the Dow and S&P 500. They aren’t generating as much revenue and profit from markets around the world.So the hard times for smaller stocks might be a more accurate barometer of the US financial landscape than what’s happening with big tech companies like Apple(AAPL), Microsoft(MSFT) and Google owner Alphabet(GOOGL) — which have held up much better during the recent market pullback.You could be waiting a while for the next hot IPO “Peel the onion back one layer and there has been a more severe rotation in stocks under the surface,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.Sonders noted that many of the smaller companies in the S&P 500 beyond the top techs have been prone to big corrections in the past year. It’s just that there are enough “pockets of strength” among the larger firms in the index to mask the broader weakness in the overall market.This divergence has caught the attention of other strategists on Wall Street too. David Wright, co-founder of Sierra Mutual Funds, noted in a recent report that far more stocks on the NYSE and Nasdaq have been hitting new 52-week lows rather than highs as of late.“What this means is that only a few large stocks are holding the indexes up, while an increasing number of stocks are actually in a bear market already,” Wright said.The market pullback in smaller stocks is a big reason why the CNN Business Fear & Greed Index has suddenly plunged into nearly “extreme fear” territory after registering levels of “extreme greed” just a month ago. The volume of shares in stocks going down is also higher than those going up. Small companies also may not be able to afford paying higher wages to workers as easily as corporate behemoths. Profit margins (and overall earnings) could take a hit as they try to stay competitive with salaries, bonuses and other compensation. GameStop(GME) will report earnings after the close Wednesday. The stock, along with movie theater chain AMC(AMC), has become synonymous with the meme stock revolution powered by traders on Reddit and other social media sites.Shares of GameStop are up more than 850% so far in 2021. But the stock has had an extremely bumpy ride, to put it mildly. GameStop is also trading nearly 65% below the all-time high it hit in January. It’s easy to forget that GameStop is actually a legitimate business and not just a “stonk” that became a plaything of traders trying to punish short selling hedge funds that were betting against the company.Where are all of the PlayStations? How gamers are handling the global shortageFor what it’s worth, there are growing hopes that the company’s business is turning around under Matt Furlong, the new CEO and former Amazon(AMZN) executive who joined GameStop earlier this year.GameStop has also made a bigger push into e-commerce since Chewy(CHWY) co-founder Ryan Cohen took a big stake in the company and was subsequently named chairman. The company is still expected to post a loss for the current quarter. But Wall Street is predicting a profit in the holiday period that ends in January and is forecasting that GameStop will make money in its next fiscal year. Demand for video games at GameStop should be strong. The bigger challenge could be the widely publicized shortages of Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and Sony’s(SNE) PS5 consoles due to the global supply chain issues impacting semiconductors.Monday: Germany factory productionTuesday: AutoZone(AZO), Toll Brothers(TOL), Stitch Fix(SFIX) earningsWednesday: China trade report; Campbell Soup(CPB), Brown-Forman(BFB), GameStop earningsThursday: China inflation; US jobless claims; Hormel(HRL), Costco(COST), Broadcom(AVGO), Chewy, Lululemon(LULU) earnings Friday: US consumer prices; University of Michigan consumer sentimentMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

85,,"If the Jazz Police began launching midnight raids against musicians who offended their sensibilities, Kenny G would be at the top of their list.The 65-year-old saxophone player has been called the best-selling instrumentalist of all time, someone whose songs have formed the sonic backdrop of so many weddings, shopping mall and dental office visits that one music critic said he’s “part of the musical furniture of American culture.”The Jazz Police – fans and critics who are self-appointed enforcers of jazz purity – have called Kenny G’s music “safe sax” and compared it to takeout Chinese food (“an hour later you’re hungry again”). Jazz guitarist Pat Metheny has dismissed Kenny G’s style as “lame-ass, jive, pseudo bluesy out-of-tune, noodling.” But a new documentary film by Penny Lane may lead some of Kenny G’s critics to reconsider. “Listening to Kenny G,” which premiered this week on HBO Max, offers surprising glimpses into the songs and private life of the skinny, White guy who became the face – and hair – of smooth jazz. The film suggests that Kenny G, who just released his first album in six years, is not only unappreciated but a groundbreaking artist who pursues perfection and innovation in his own sweet way. The documentary also asks bigger questions outside of music. It explores racial prejudice and the art vs. commerce debate, and offers some lessons on what it takes for someone to be successful in any field.What comes through is that Kenny G probably would have been successful at whatever he chose to do. He is relentless striver – practicing his sax at least three hours each day – with a compulsive need to get better at everything, even if it’s just baking an apple pie in his opulent kitchen.Kenny G’s devotion to his craft, though, will probably not impress his critics. His music has been described as bland and soporific – like an aural hit of Ambien. It has furnished many Internet memes, and shows like “Saturday Night Live” and “South Park” have made fun of his “Snooze Jazz.”Some of the funniest scenes in the documentary come when jazz critics are asked to appraise Kenny G’s music. Many squirm like toddlers at the dentist, with looks of discomfort across their faces as Kenny G standards like “Songbird” play in the background.When Ben Ratliff, a well known jazz and pop music critic, was asked what he thought of Kenny G’s music, he struggled to give an assessment. “I’m sure I heard of a lot of Kenny G’s music – while waiting for something,” Ratcliff says, referring to the piped-in music he hears in stores or during visits to his bank.Another critic, though, cited Kenny G’s massive popularity – he has sold at least 75 million records – as a form of defense.“It can’t simply be that millions of people are just stupid and Pat Metheny is the smart one,” says Jason King, a musician and scholar at New York University. The center of the documentary, though, is Kenny G himself. His canny deflections of his detractors take the film in unexpected directions.Kenny G refrains from labeling his own music. Is it jazz, pop? You tell me, he says. He also dismisses the notion that he deliberately set out to create jazz Muzak that would appeal to the masses.“These are songs from my heart,” he says. “This is just the way I hear it. They [critics] think I just decided to play these songs because I knew they would sell well. If only I was that smart.”But the film makes clear, as it traces his rise in the musical world, that Kenny G is a lot smarter than people realize.He was born Kenneth Bruce Gorelick in Seattle, Washington, a quiet Jewish kid who was expected to take over his father’s plumbing business one day. But young Kenny became enthralled by the silky music of jazz saxophonist Grover Washington Jr., whose hits like “Just The Two of Us” heralded the 1980s rise of the smooth jazz genre.Kenny G’s high school music teacher recalls him as a shy kid with no girlfriend who was “super, super smart.” The teacher tells a funny story about Kenny G stealing the show during one of his first live gigs by holding a prolonged note – a signature stage move that would be recognizable to any of his fans today.Some of the best scenes show Kenny G’s cockiness. He’s also an outstanding golfer as well as a pilot and a successful investor. “That’s a hard lick and I just played it really well,” he says with a self-satisfied smile after an impressive practice run on his soprano sax.The film also does a good job explaining why some jazz critics despise him. Many say his music is not jazz. Jazz, they say, is about improvisation and vigorous interplay between musicians who are testing musical boundaries. Those qualities don’t describe Kenny G’s music.But even some of his critics concede that Kenny G created a new type of instrumental music with massive hits like “Songbird” and “Silhouette.”What’s inarguable is that he has a distinctive sound that’s sold millions of records. How many musicians can claim that?“I don’t think a lot of people could say they created a new sound, but I did,” he says.Some dismiss that sound as “easy listening,” but Kenny G seems nonplussed by the label.“When you hear the words, ‘easy listening,’ it almost sounds bad,” he says. “Well, I don’t see anything wrong with something that’s easy to listen to.”Jazz purists criticize Kenny G because they don’t think his music reflects any exceptional jazz chops or innovation. They also complain that he’s earned so many millions from his music while many jazz musicians who are much more skilled toil in relative obscurity.As the film makes clear, the debate over what constitutes true jazz is as old as jazz itself.Louis Armstrong is widely seen as the greatest jazz musician of all time for his virtuoso trumpet playing and singing. But is “What a Wonderful World,” one of his biggest hits, jazz? And if not, does it tarnish his legacy?Miles Davis, another jazz legend, was accused of selling out when he went electric on his album “Bitches Brew,” which helped launch jazz fusion music in the 1970s. Yet no one would claim Davis isn’t an authentic jazz artist.Besides, there is another purpose that jazz, and all music, serves.Music offers people an escape, a way to feel good. Some of the most moving passages in the documentary show Kenny G’s wide appeal. His fans come in all races, age groups and nationalities (he’s huge in China). The film depicts them all blissfully nodding along to his music with the same contented look.The great jazz drummer Art Blakely once said that “jazz washes away the dust of everyday life.”Kenny G’s music may not fit the classical definition of jazz. And it may put some listeners to sleep.But maybe we shouldn’t underestimate a musician who can wash away the dust of everyday life for many listeners who are worn down by living in an increasingly divided world.If we go by that standard, Kenny G just might be a maestro. © 2023 Cable News Network.

86,,"At least 14 people are dead and hundreds are displaced after Mount Semeru, a volcano in Indonesia’s East Java province, erupted on Saturday, authorities said. Indonesia’s National Board for Disaster Management (BNPB) said in a statement Sunday the eruption had wounded 56 others, with 35 people in serious condition, after it covered villages with ash and left people to run from billowing clouds of debris. Five of the victims have yet to be identified and nine people are still missing, the BNPB said. Some 1,300 people have been displaced by the eruption and reached evacuation centers, it added.Hundreds of houses have been totally destroyed and 33 schools have been damaged by the eruption, according to the BNPB.Officials say the situation at Mount Semeru remains dangerous due to the risk of pyroclastic flows – amix of ash, rock and volcanic gases that can be much more dangerous than lava.“We recommend everyone to increase their alert because the potential of pyroclastic flows threat is still high. It can happen anytime without any warning,” Chief of the Mount Semeru Observation Post, Liswanto, told CNN Sunday.Liswanto said on Sunday his team recorded two pyroclastic flow events. The first was at 5 a.m. local and second one was at 10 a.m. local time. The deadly volcanic material was rolling down to Curah Kobokan village, which was evacuated on Saturday. They have urged people living up to 6 miles away from the volcano to evacuate as pyroclastic flows “is very hot, the temperature can reach more than 1000 Celsius,” Liswanto said.Since there is no sign or method to predict when the pyroclastic flow will occur, the phenomenon can be very dangerous, Liswanto said. One rescue volunteer in Indonesia’s Lumajang district told CNN Sunday that he and his team evacuated the bodies of six miners from a river in Curah Kobokan village, where they were mining sand in the river bank.Some of the miners were still inside their trucks, while others were discovered laying on the ground near the trucks, said 32-year-old volunteer Muhammad Firman Adiguna Effasa. It is unclear if those six deaths are part of the 14 deaths that authorities announced. He added he was worried that more miners or other victims could be still out there but won’t survive because the lava flood was so intense. Authorities have converted schools, mosques, village halls and village houses into evacuation centers, the statement said.Java is the largest population center in Indonesia’s massive island archipelago and home to the capital city of Jakarta. Standing at more than 12,000 feet high, Mount Semeru is the tallest mountain on Java. Indonesia s Mount Merapi volcano erupts, spews clouds of ashVolcanic ash and the smell of sulfur was first reported around 3 p.m. local time (3 a.m. ET), according to the Mount Semeru Volcano Observation Post. The station added that hot ash clouds were falling towards an East Java village, Sapitarang, in Pronojiwo District.Videos shared by government emergency response teams showed residents in the area running away from huge thick clouds of ash. Other footage shared by locals showed people gathering at a local mosque in Besuk Kobokan as smoke blankets the surrounding streets. Following the explosion rescue officials scrambled to evacuate victims from the surrounding area. Indah Amperawati, deputy head of Lumajang District, an area close to the volcano said Saturday that most of the burn victims have been evacuated to the Penanggal Primarily Health Center alongside a resident who died in the village of Curah Kobokan.Emergency services had been unable to reach several other villages due to roads being blocked by mud and fallen trees, Indah told the press conference. The military has been asked for people and equipment to support rescue efforts, Maj. Gen. TNI Suharyanto, the head of the BNPB, told the press conference. Budi Santosa, head of disaster management of East Java province, said Saturday that two sub districts had been “badly affected” by the volcano’s eruption.Santosa told the news conference that he believed health facilities in the disaster area, either primary health centers or hospitals, would be able to accommodate victims.On Sunday, the Indonesian government said it is now preparing a relocation process for villagers who lost their home and in the next six months the BNPB will provide them with financial aid before the government can relocate them. Indonesia sits between two continental plates on what is known as the Ring of Fire, a band around the basin of the Pacific Ocean that leads to high levels of tectonic and volcanic activity.© 2023 Cable News Network.

87,,"One man is bringing back memories, and delicious food, for the community of Abilene, Texas.Dusty Hudgins was going through his late mother’s things when he found her old cookbooks from the 1960s. Florice Hudgins was a cafeteria worker in the Abilene school district in the 1960s and ’70s, Hudgins told CNN.The book that stood out to him was titled “Our Favorite Recipes” and comprised recipes loved by women in the food service industry who worked in the schools.Though the book was made in the ’60s — with recipes including cornbread, Southern stuffing, and barbecue chicken – several of the recipes seem more old-fashioned, including one for a chicken loaf with fruit. The grandmothers around the world sharing their best recipesHudgins said he decided to go out on limb and post his recent find to a Facebook group called “Remember in Abilene when…,” which reflects on the city’s history.The post received hundreds of comments and likes.“It just kind of blew up,” Hudgins said.Some community members commented they had the same cookbook and have used it for years. It’s also through the post that someone was able to help Hudgins find the original publisher of the book.“Someone sent me a card that they had inside their copy of the cookbook, which had the name of the publishing company on it.” Hudgins said.From there, he got in contact with the company and to his surprise, it was still in business.The company took Hudgins’ copy of the relic and reprinted copies, which he is now selling for charity.“The cover of the new book is a little off-white because of some stains from the original cover,” Hudgins said. “They paid a lot of attention to detail and it looks nice.”After coverage of Hudgins’ journey, hundreds have ordered copies. Hudgins told CNN, “That’s all I’ve been doing – sending invoices, printing shipping labels, going to the post office.”Each recipe in the book is followed by a name, Hudgins said – and that has connected many people to recipes from family members they may not have even known about.A sweet potato pie tradition that almost wasn t, and other stories of unforgettable family recipes“I’ve heard from quite a few people that tell that the recipe was their grandmother’s or great aunt,” Hudgins said.The 1960s book also lists some ingredients that may be unfamiliar to modern-day chefs.“As you look through the recipes in the book, some of them call for things like Crisco, Accent and oleo, and some people don’t know what those things are,” Hudgins explained. “I had one guy tell me he was going to make the peach cobbler; well, it calls for oleo and he said he had to call his grandmother to find out what that was.”Crisco and Accent – a shortening and seasoning – are still sold today, while oleo is an old term for margarine.Hudgins sells the books through his Facebook page for $20 a copy.All proceeds go towards Love and Care Ministries, which helps feed school children on weekends and during the holiday season. © 2023 Cable News Network.

88,,"Art has always had the power to be dangerous. But a newly opened art museum is taking that to another level.It’s Unimaru’s location that makes it unsafe. The museum rests on the DMZ, or Korean Demilitarized Zone, a no-man’s-land along the 38th parallel which divides North and South Korea. Its inaugural exhibition, titled “2021 DMZ Art and Peace Platform,” featured 34 artworks by 32 artists and opened in September 2021.Prior to becoming a museum, Unimaru was a customs clearinghouse, where visitors went through security screening before being allowed to visit the DMZ from 2003 to 2007. This was then replaced by a bigger office. The building sat empty until early 2021, when architecture firm MPART – who also designed the National Museum of Modern Contemporary Art (MMCA) in Seoul – reimagined it as Unimaru. The museum’s name is a portmanteau of two Korean words: “uni,” meaning one, and “maru,” meaning space.Its roof was opened up so that visitors could see more of the view and a steel facade “which represents the liminality of time and space at the DMZ,” according to a statement from the museum. In a trendy Seoul neighborhood, a taste of repressive North Korea Due to both security and coronavirus concerns, visitor numbers are intentionally kept small. A maximum of five tour groups per day, with no more than 30 people per group, were allowed when the museum was open. Now Unimaru is on hiatus as it mounts its next exhibit.People who want to visit must apply to the South Korea Ministry of Unification (MOU) – the official government body that promotes reunification of the Koreas and dialogue between the two countries – for permission. Once approved, they are secured a free ticket to Unimaru and can board one of the special buses allowed to ferry civilian guests to the DMZ.After having their IDs checked, guests are escorted around the museum by docents and staffers from the MOU. These MOU staffers are civilians and do not carry weapons.All visitors to the DMZ must abide by a dress code that bans miniskirts, shorts, and anything with camouflage print. They are not allowed to wave at anyone they might see or take pictures of anything without permission, just in case they run afoul of security issues. Kids under 8 years old are also barred from the DMZ, regardless of their country of origin. Hotels of Pyongyang: New book takes readers inside North Korean capital s colorful accommodationsIn 2018, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korea’s chairman Kim Jong Un held an Inter-Korean Summit Meeting at the “Peace House” at Panmunjom on the DMZ.Technically, the two nations are still at war, but at the meeting Moon and Kim agreed to move toward formally ending their conflict. The agreement also stated that both countries would remove weapons, guards and landmines from Joint Security Area (JSA).It was the departure of guards from some of the military watchpoints that allowed Unimaru to display artwork on a repurposed former guard tower just a mile from the border.Yeon Shim Chung, UniMaru’s artistic director, told Artnet that she or other museum staff members wear bulletproof vests as a precaution when they go to install pieces there.Artwork from both South Korean and international artists is on display at Unimaru.However, one of the most striking installations is an empty frame that represents where the museum hopes to someday display work from North Korean artists.The JSA, or Panmunjom, is probably the best known place along the DMZ because of its recognizable bright-blue conference room, which is the most-visited attraction in the area. Former US President Bill Clinton famously said that the DMZ was the “scariest place on earth” after a state visit there in 1993.Panmunjom tours resumed on November 30, after being suspended in July as South Korea tightened its Covid-19 restrictions.© 2023 Cable News Network.

 A SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule carrying four astronauts roared into outer space atop a Falcon 9 rocket on Wednesday, marking the kick off of SpaceX’s fifth crewed mission to orbit. The spacecraft, with three NASA astronauts and one European astronaut onboard, will spend all day Wednesday maneuvering closer to the International Space Station (ISS), where it’ll dock late Thursday kicking off a six-month science and research mission. The astronauts will spend the next day strapped inside their spacecraft as it maneuvers through orbit and prepares to link up with the ISS, which orbits more than 200 miles above Earth’s surface. Docking is scheduled for 7:10 pm ET Thursday. This mission, called Crew-3, is the fourth mission in a partnership between SpaceX and NASA to make routine trips to the ISS in order to keep the 21-year-old space station adequately staffed. That’s something NASA has wanted to have more control over since its Space Shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving Russia as the only country with the ability to provide ISS transportation. But SpaceX’s Crew Dragon is far from another space shuttle. The company still owns and operates the vehicle and NASA is considered just another customer for these missions.In fact, the four professional astronauts on the Crew-3 mission —NASA’s Raja Chari, Tom Marshburn, and Kayla Barron, as well as the European Space Agency’s Matthias Maurer — will be the first to board a Crew Dragon since SpaceX’s Inspiration4 all-civilian tourist mission. That mission carried four people, none of whom were professional astronauts, on a three-day space flight that orbited higher than any spacecraft has traveled since the moon missions of the 1970s.In a press conference earlier this week, NASA’s Commercial Crew Program manager described the Inspiration mission as a “gift” because it brought issues with a key component on the Crew Dragon spacecraft — the toilet — into the spotlight so the problem could be fixed for future NASA missions.“The Inspiration4 crew were alerted to an issue with the onboard toilet’s fan, which is used to create suction that is necessary when going to the bathroom in microgravity. After the spacecraft returned home, SpaceX disassembled the capsule and found “contamination.” SpaceX splashdown: Astronauts return home from six-month ISS mission“There’s a storage tank where the the urine goes to be stored [and] there’s a tube that came disconnected or came unglued,” said William Gerstenmaier, a former associate administrator at NASA who now works as SpaceX’s head of mission assurance, during a press conference last month. “That allowed urine essentially to not go into the storage tank, but essentially go into the fan system.”The issue also prevented a group of astronauts from using their Crew Dragon spacecraft’s on-board toilet during their trek back to Earth from the International Space Station on Monday. The astronauts had found their capsule also had evidence of “contamination” from a leaky toilet, according to NASA. They were forced instead to rely on undergarments — essentially adult diapers — during their nine-hour return trip. The Crew-3 launch comes after another group of four astronauts returned from the ISS on Monday, capping off the mission dubbed Crew-2.Both of the flights came as SpaceX and NASA worked to troubleshoot issues with the design of the toilet onboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule. The issue left the Crew-2 astronauts without a bathroom option during their nine-hour return flight from the ISS on Monday. NASA and SpaceX said the issue had been fixed on the capsule used to launch the Crew-3 mission Wednesday.SpaceX had intended to launch this mission, called Crew-3, on Halloween, but liftoff was delayed because of some rough weather over the Atlantic Ocean that could’ve impacted rescue operations if the rocket were to misfire and force the astronauts to make an emergency splashdown landing in the ocean. Crew Dragon’s ability to jettison a crew to safety if something goes wrong is one of the reasons the space agency says it is among the safest spacecraft ever flown. Such an emergency exit has never had to be carried out by SpaceX, but having that option — and ensuring a recovery could be smoothly executed — is one of the reasons the space agency says Crew Dragon is among the safest spacecraft ever flown. The flight was then delayed further by a “medical issue involving one of the Crew-3 astronauts,” according to NASA. The issue was not a medical emergency nor was it Covid-related, the space agency said, though it declined to give further details.Kayla Barron, who has a a master’s degree in nuclear engineering from the University of Cambridge, was selected as a NASA astronaut in 2017 and comes directly from a field of work that involves extreme living conditions and long bouts of isolation: submarines. Barron became one of the first women ever to serve on a Navy submarine back in 2010.“It wasn’t until I had that experience of living and working beneath the surface of the ocean and made the connection to living and working in the vacuum of space and understanding the kind of team it took to do that successfully,” Barron told reporters last month. “All those parallels are what gave me the confidence to…apply [for NASA’s astronaut corps] in the first place.”Raja Chari also joined NASA’s astronaut corps in 2017 as one of its newest inductees, and marks his first flight to space. He has a master’s degree in aeronautics and astronautics from MIT and graduated from the US Naval Test Pilot School, which has a long history of providing a pipeline to the astronaut corps.Chari and Barron have also both been selected for NASA’s corps of Artemis astronauts, who could fly on future missions to the Moon. Barron added that taking a trip to the ISS is “the best possible training for us” to prepare for an eventual lunar mission, “in terms of personal development and the opportunity to learn from experienced people.” It’s also the first time in space for Germany’s Matthias Maurer of the ESA, who’ll have the opportunity to conduct a spacewalk and activate a new robotic arm, which was recently transported to the space station aboard a Russian spacecraft. “This arm will be able to bring science payloads through an Russian airlock from the inside of the station towards the outside, and then we [will be] able to run experiments on the outside without performing a spacewalk,” he said. The mission’s pilot, NASA’s Tom Marshburn, is the sole veteran astronaut among the crew. He has a background in physics and holds a doctorate of medicine, and he first joined NASA in the early 1990s as a flight surgeon. He joined the official astronaut corps in 2004 and has previously flown on one Space Shuttle mission and one Russian Soyuz mission to the ISS.When asked what he’s most looking forward to, Marshburn told reporters that “certainly one of the pinnacles of your time up on board is having the opportunity to do a spacewalk, but what we’re doing day to day in the laboratory is going to be what many of us look forward to the most.”The ISS has for two decades hosted astronauts from all over the world to conduct scientific research. The space station is unlike any laboratory in the world — in the microgravity environment, physical and biological phenomena aren’t bogged down by the Earth’s pull. So, doing the same experiment on the station that’s been done on the ground can give scientists a better fundamental understanding of how something works.The research the Crew-3 astronauts will oversee includes an attempt to grow a “perfect crystal” to enhance our understanding of biological processes, a test of the impact of diet on astronaut health, and the testing of a smartphone video guidance sensor for guidance, navigation, and control of the Astrobee free-flying robot.

91,,"The Department of Homeland Security warned in a new terrorism bulletin Wednesday of a “​​diverse and challenging threat environment” ahead of the holidays, pointing to the spread of violent extremist narratives online, coronavirus pandemic-related stressors and the potential to exploit recent events in Afghanistan. Although DHS is not aware of an imminent and credible threat, the public bulletin points out that upcoming religious holidays and associated mass gatherings have previously served as potential targets for acts of violence.The latest bulletin largely reflects concerns included in the previous August bulletin but was issued to keep the public updated on the ongoing threats facing the US, according to the department. This is the Biden administration’s fourth National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin, which is issued regularly to inform the public and law enforcement about national terrorism threats and to telegraph the need to be alert and report suspicious activity.The bulletin notes that pandemic-related stressors have contributed to increased societal strains and tensions, driving several plots by domestic violent extremists. Those stressors “may contribute to more violence this and next year,” the bulletin reads. DHS is concerned that if a new Covid-19 variant emerges and additional public health restrictions are imposed, anti-government violent extremists “could potentially use the new restrictions as a rationale to target government or public health officials or facilities.”On some online platforms connected to domestic violent extremism, there has been a fairly consistent focus on public health restrictions imposed because of Covid-19 and content that describes those restrictions as government overreach, according to a senior DHS official. The US withdrawal from Afghanistan has also impacted the national threat environment. Foreign terrorist organizations and domestic extremists will likely continue to attempt to inspire potential US-based followers to engage in violent activity, including by exploiting recent events in Afghanistan, the bulletin reads. Additionally, some domestic extremists have attempted to use the relocation of Afghan nationals to the US to exacerbate grievances over immigration and the American Muslim community.The potential for conspiracy theory-fueled violence also remains a major concern for the department. According to the bulletin, law enforcement officials have expressed concerns that the broad sharing of false narratives and conspiracy theories that endorse the use of violence will continue to gain traction.The online activity of foreign and domestic threat actors is fueling the volatility of the current threat environment, the senior DHS official said.“We continue to be concerned about the use of online platforms by domestic extremist organizations, foreign terrorist groups, foreign intelligence services as they seek to spread conspiracy theories, disinformation for the express purpose of inspiring acts of violence in the US,” the official said of the bulletin.During a House Intelligence Committee hearing last week, DHS Counterterrorism Coordinator John Cohen said the department has put more emphasis on analyzing online threats of violence in the wake of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.“We have become much more forward leaning as it relates to the analyzing of online activity and evaluating activity from the perspective of the potential risk of violence,” he said. Cohen told the committee that DHS is “much more cognizant and mindful” about incorporating that threat-related information into operational planning. He pointed to Inauguration Day as an example. The response by law enforcement to Inauguration Day “was very different” from weeks earlier, he said, and included physical security measures in and around the Capitol and other locations as well as a highly visible presence of National Guard and law enforcement in Washington, DC, and state capitals around the country.Comments about Inauguration Day on social media and extremist platforms reflected an understanding of those security measures and a reluctance to come to Washington, Cohen said, adding that “those who were planning acts of violence viewed it as a trap being set for their arrest or viewed it as not the right time to come and engage because of the security presence.”The lesson from that, he said, is that DHS analysis has focused more on understanding when there may be a potential act of violence, and then taking steps – sometimes very visible – to create security measures that serve as a deterrent. © 2023 Cable News Network.

92,,"President Joe Biden took his sales pitch for the newly passed bipartisan infrastructure deal on the road Wednesday, highlighting the effect of the bill on supply chains and acknowledging Americans’ concerns about rising prices – hours after new inflation statistics revealed that US consumer prices are surging more than they have in 30 years. While the Biden White House has long sought to assuage national worries about inflation amid America’s economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, the President on Wednesday acknowledged that rising consumer prices are “one of the most pressing economic concerns of the American people – and it’s real.” The President said the administration is prioritizing “getting prices down,” “making sure our stores are fully stocked” and getting a lot of people back to work while tackling these two above challenges I mentioned.” Data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday indicated that US consumer price inflation surged higher again in October. Over the past 12 months, prices climbed 6.2% – the biggest increase since November 1990.After stripping out food and energy prices, which tend to be more volatile, the index rose 4.6% over the same period, the biggest jump since August 1991.Speaking from the Port of Baltimore late Wednesday afternoon, Biden told the audience that “everything from a gallon of gas to a loaf of bread costs more. And it’s worrisome, even though wages are going up.” “(O)n the good side, we’re seeing the highest growth rate in decades, the fastest decrease in unemployment … since 1950 … but we’ve got problems, too,” he continued. “Many people remain unsettled about the economy and we all know why. They see higher prices. They go to the store … or online and they can’t find what they always want and when they want it. And we’re tracking these issues and trying to figure out how to tackle them head on.” Biden cited specific provisions in the newly passed infrastructure deal – which he will sign into law on Monday – that aim to address some of the pressure points leading to inflation. He also pointed to specific funding that will aid ports – like the one he spoke from in Baltimore – and ease supply chain issues. “It’s going to modernize our ports with $17 billion dollars in investment. … We’re going to reduce congestion. We’re going to address repair and maintenance backlogs, deploy state of the art technologies and make our ports cleaner and more efficient. And we’re going to do the same with our airports and freight rail,” the President said. The President said he’d received personal assurances in a recent meeting with the heads of leading retailers and freight movers that shelves will be stocked for the holiday season.“Yesterday, … I spoke to the CEOs of the major retailers, Walmart, Target – and the leading freight movers, FedEx and UPS. They assured me that the shelves will be stocked in stores this holiday because they signed on a 24/7 (operations),” Biden said. Biden also noted his administration’s plan for ports, released on Tuesday. The new set of immediate and short-term actions are aimed at alleviating supply chain issues at the nation’s ports, waterways and freight networks as the administration takes steps to implement the infrastructure bill.The new actions include flexibility for port grants through the Department of Transportation to solve supply chain disruptions, funding for a pop-up container yard project underway at the Port of Savannah, a $420 million grant program for ports and marine highways that will be launched within the next 45 days, and identifying coastal and waterway projects for $4 billion in funding for US Army Corps of Engineers construction.It will also prioritize identifying key US ports of entry for $3.4 billion in modernization and expansion projects within 90 days and open competition for $475 million in port infrastructure grants through the bipartisan bill within 90 days.In a statement released earlier Wednesday to address the stark inflation statistics, Biden said that some “price increases reflect the ongoing struggle to restore smooth operations in the economy in the restart.”“And I want to reemphasize my commitment to the independence of the Federal Reserve to monitor inflation, and take steps necessary to combat it,” he added. A senior administration official had told reporters on Tuesday that the Baltimore visit would be “an illustrative example” of the private-public partnership at the nation’s ports.Biden’s stop in Charm City took place near the 127 year-old Howard Street Tunnel, which “only accommodates single stack containers right now.” It “will be expanded to accommodate double stack containers from the Port of Baltimore all the way out to the Midwest,” in a project co-funded by federal, state and private partners, the official said.“It’s an example of the kind of investments that are needed for both the private- and public-sector side. It’s also an illustration that the co-funding in the bipartisan infrastructure plan incentivizes the private sector to make these kinds of long-term investments as well,” the official added.CNN’s Anneken Tappe and Sam Fossum contributed to this report.

93,,"The US Justice Department announced on Wednesday that a federal grand jury indicted three men for operating two fraudulent political action committees during the 2016 election and collecting approximately $3.5 million from unwitting contributors. Federal prosecutors allege that the men, Matthew Tunstall, Kyle Davies and Robert Reyes, solicited contributions to two PACs – one progressive called Progressive Priorities PAC and one conservative called Liberty Action Group – by using robocalls and written solicitations meant to imply they were supporting 2016 presidential candidates.The PACs’ operators then used the funds to enrich themselves and pay for more robocalls and advertisements, according to the Department of Justice. The PACs’ activities were first uncovered by KFile in 2016 and 2017, first at BuzzFeed and later at CNN. “Between January 2016 and April 2017, the defendants obtained approximately $3.5 million from unwitting donors based on false and misleading representations and used those funds to enrich themselves and to pay for additional fraudulent advertisements soliciting donations,” the DOJ wrote in a press release announcing the indictments. “Tunstall and Reyes are also alleged to have laundered more than $350,000 in illegal proceeds from the scheme through a third-party vendor to conceal the use of those funds for their own benefit.” Aaron Wiley, Reyes’ attorney, told CNN he plans to plead not guilty and had cooperated with the investigation. CNN has reached out to Tunstall and his court-appointed attorney and to Davies but has yet to hear back.A CNN KFile investigation from July 2021 found that Tunstall has continued to operate two different PACs since 2018 and raised millions of additional dollars through robocall solicitations that used the voice of Donald Trump and borrowed language from his campaign. The two PACs, which are not mentioned in the indictment, bear all the hallmarks of a scam PAC, according to experts. Tunstall has been living in Los Angeles under the assumed name of Matte Nox, where he claims to be an “award-winning writer” and “executive producer,” according to his online biography, as reported by CNN in July. In his LinkedIn accounts, he describes himself as an investor in “women-led ventures,” including a modeling agency and a beauty company that sells face masks. The Justice Department rarely prosecutes the operators of fraudulent PACs – approximately one to two cases a year, according to experts.Tunstall made his first appearance in court on Tuesday in California, and Davies and Reyes are scheduled to appear in court on Wednesday. Tunstall and Reyes both face a maximum total penalty of 125 years in prison if convicted on all counts and Davies faces a maximum total penalty of 65 years in prison.The Department of Justice declined to comment beyond its press release.© 2023 Cable News Network.

97,,"Published 10:37 PM EST, Thu January 6, 2022 A severe winter storm left some motorists stranded for more than 24 hours this week as they traveled on Interstate 95 in eastern Virginia.The storm dumped more than a foot of snow in the area between Richmond and Washington, DC, but a big part of the problem was that disabled trucks were blocking the way, transportation officials said. Many people, lacking food and water, abandoned their vehicles as they waited for traffic to start moving again. Others stayed inside, turning their engines on occasionally for heat and then turning them off to conserve fuel. The 50-mile stretch of I-95 was eventually reopened on Tuesday night. Here are some of the other stories that made headlines over the past week, as well as some photos that caught our eye.© 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

98,,"The flames erupted before sunrise Wednesday and the sound of emergency sirens alerted neighbors in the Fairmount area of Philadelphia that something was wrong. Shortly after, the devastating scale was clear: 12 people, including children, had died in a fire at a row home. 12dead, including 8 children, in Philadelphia fire athouse converted into apartments, officials say“It was terrible,” Philadelphia Deputy Fire Commissioner Craig Murphy said of the scene. “This is probably one of the worst fires I ever been to.”Firefighters faced heavy smoke, heat and limited visibility on all floors when they entered the building, a news release from the city said. Rescuers pulled a child from the building, who did not survive, and two other people were taken to hospitals, officials said. Eight people were able to escape by themselves, Murphy said.“This is without a doubt one of the most tragic days in our city’s history – loss of so many people in such a tragic way,” Mayor Jim Kenney said Wednesday morning. “Losing so many kids is just devastating. … Keep these babies in your prayers.”Here’s what we know about the tragedy and the investigation: Family members told CNN three women and nine children were victims in the deadly fire. Sisters Rosalee McDonald, 33, Virginia Thomas, 30, and Quinsha White, 18, were killed. Six of McDonald’s children and three of Thomas’ children also died in the fire, according to their families. The ages of their children were not given.Thomas’ 5-year-old son survived, her cousin told CNN. A city news release initially said eight children and four adults were killed in the fire.“They were both good people, good mothers and were very family-oriented,” Frank McDonald told CNN. “Rosalee was one of the best people you could ever meet. She was very supportive – they both were. They came down to help me with my business when I opened it.”Qaadira Purifoy said her family suffered an unimaginable loss. Two of her sisters and four of her nieces and nephews died in the fire, she told CNN affiliate KYW-TV. “Losing sisters, I never thought this would happen,” Purifoy said. “Sisters, nieces and nephews.”Debra Jackson’s sister was able to escape the home’s first floor with three of her children, she told KYW-TV.“Two of her sons got burned, she probably is just smoke inhalation. But thank God that they’re alive,” Jackson said. “My heart goes out to the family that lost all their family.”Philadelphia’s school district said Wednesday it was working with City Council President Darrell Clarke to set up a fund to help the affected families. Some of the children who died were students in city schools, the district said, without saying how many. The district said it also has made counseling and support services available for grieving students. Neighbors and others – some sobbing – gathered outside the burned row house as firefighters and police worked the scene Wednesday morning, CNN affiliate WPVI reported.Bill Richards, who said he’s lived on the block for 24 years, told WPVI that before he knew of the fire, he heard a woman yell, “Oh, my God! Oh, my God!” He then heard fire trucks and went outside.“It’s very upsetting,” Richards told WPVI. “I just can’t wrap myself around it.”Richards described the area as “a very family-oriented neighborhood.”“We’ll help each other get through the grief,” he said.The fire took place at a home that records show is owned by the Philadelphia Housing Authority, a municipal agency that leases homes to people with low income.It was a row home that had been legally subdivided into two apartments since the 1950s and has had no violations, according to a spokesperson for the Philadelphia Department of Licenses and Inspections.The building, according to records, was estimated to have been built in 1920.Officials with the Philadelphia Housing Authority said Thursday there were 20 people living between the two subdivided units in the row home, despite fire officials saying Wednesday there were 26.“I don’t know how they were able to ascertain that,” said Kelvin A. Jeremiah, PHA president and CEO. “The authorized number of residents would be the folks who are indicated on our leases, and in both of those units the combined total should be 20 – six and 14.”In 2011, three people moved into Unit A and six into Unit B. In the four-bedroom unit B, the family grew between 2011 and 2021, with at least eight children added to the household, Jeremiah said.Jeremiah described the family in Unit B as a multi-generational family consisting of a grandmother, her three daughters and their children. The family wanted to stay together and the PHA does not have occupancy limits.“Our policies and procedures do not evict people because they have children,” Jeremiah said. “We don’t remove them because their families are growing.”Firefighters responded to flames around 6:40 a.m. Wednesday and found “heavy fire” in a kitchen area at the front of the second floor, officials said. There was “nothing slowing that fire from moving,” Murphy, the fire commissioner, noted.Investigators are trying to determine if a child under the age of 5 playing with a lighter under a tree was the cause of the deadly fire, according to Jane Roh, spokesperson for the Philadelphia District Attorney’s office.This is just one avenue investigators are pursuing, among other leads, Roh said, and there are currently no plans to bring charges against anyone in relation to the fire.Neither PHA nor fire officials would comment on the suspected cause of the fire Thursday.Murphy told reporters during a news conference Thursday that the Philadelphia Police Department and the ATF Philadelphia branch were assisting with the investigation.“It’s a very traumatic scene, it’s a very complex investigation,” said Fire Deputy Chief Dennis Merrigan with the Philadelphia Fire Marshal’s Office. “It’s something that would challenge us if we had to do it on our own.”Matthew Varisco, ATF special agent in charge, said there will be no expense spared in the investigation.The resources that will be deployed, Merrigan said, include laser scanners.“It’s like 3D cameras. As opposed to taking hundreds and hundreds of still pictures, we’re going to scan the entire room, that way it’s almost like a virtual reality. We can take that scene later, go back and look at the computer and look at it in extreme detail,” he said.The city “owes it to the victims, the survivors, and to all Philadelphians to conduct a thorough investigation into this travesty, so that we can make sure it never happens again,” District Attorney Larry Krasner said.Murphy initially told reporters that four smoke detectors were in the building, “and none of them operated.”Murphy later indicated that Philadelphia Housing Authority records show that at least six battery-operated smoke detectors had been installed there from 2019 to 2020.However, Dinesh Indala, PHA’s senior executive vice president of operations, said the agency had different information about the detectors.Unit A of the apartment had seven smoke detectors and three carbon monoxide detectors at its last inspection, Indala said Thursday. Unit B had six functional smoke detectors and three functional carbon monoxide detectors as of its last inspection in May 2021, Indala said.Two batteries and two smoke detectors were replaced in 2021, Indala said. Smoke detectors also were replaced in the B unit in an inspection in September 2019, according to Indala.“When we last conducted our inspection, the smoke detectors were, in fact, working,” Jeremiah, the PHA CEO, said. “If the fire marshal determined, as a result of this fire, that they were not, in fact, working or they were not, in fact, operational, it would be that they were tampered with or the batteries were somehow removed. We don’t go into units and remove batteries.”Faulty smoke detectors are treated as emergencies and are replaced in 24 hours if requested, Indala said, and the authority does inspections annually.“Every time we come in for an inspection, as is evident from the last one, we had to replace two batteries, replace the smoke detectors. And these are 10-year smoke detectors, so that’s something we run into quite often on our properties,” Indala said.CNN’s Caroll Alvarado, Laura Dolan, Mark Morales and Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/06/us/what-we-know-philadelphia-house-fire/index.html
99,,"The Cyber Ninjas failed to prove fraud in the Arizona 2020 election, but former President Donald Trump’s election fraud crusade is now proceeding as if they’d won – pushing for more “forensic audits” and restrictive voting in that state and elsewhere across the country. Trump’s allies are already demanding a new review of another Arizona county won by President Joe Biden. They are launching more partisan ballot reviews in other states following the Arizona playbook after passing laws making it harder to vote earlier this year. And they are calling for decertification of Arizona’s 2020 election despite the lack of fraud, as part of a larger effort to validate Trump’s “Big Lie” and undermine the 2020 election results.The lesson they’re taking from Arizona’s Maricopa County ballot review is not that they failed and should stop, but rather that they should try to avoid the negative scrutiny that hounded the Cyber Ninjas’ review and “do it better” in states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, even if there’s no evidence of fraud, said Sarah Longwell, a conservative publisher and executive director of the conservative group Defending Democracy Together.“It has nothing to do with auditing votes,” Longwell told CNN. “It has to do with creating a cloud of suspicion around the elections and keeping their fraud narrative front and center.”The partisan ballot review in Maricopa County released last week reaffirmed Biden’s victory. But Trump and the Arizona GOP officials who backed it ignored that conclusion and the highly problematic nature of the review itself, run by a company inexperienced in election audits and which failed to follow standard auditing procedures, and instead touted other issues raised in their report – even though they were quickly rebutted by election experts and county officials. Similar election “audits” already are moving forward in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And Texas’ secretary of state’s office announced a “full and comprehensive forensic audit” in four counties hours after Trump fired off a letter to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott demanding just such a review. Final report from partisan Arizona review confirms Biden defeated Trump in Maricopa County last NovemberThe partisan reviews of the 2020 election results have come after a host of Republican-led state legislatures enacted restrictive voting laws, frequently citing Trump’s lies as reason to enact new measures in the name of “election integrity.” Eighteen states, including Arizona, have enacted laws this year that make it harder to vote, according to a tally by the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s School of Law.In one sign of how much the falsehoods about the 2020 election have become linked to the GOP’s identity, a recent CNN poll found that nearly 6 in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said “believing that Donald Trump won the 2020 election” was “very” or “somewhat” important to their definition of what it now means to be a Republican.Richard Hasen, an election law expert at University of California Irvine School of Law, said he once thought that it would require “some kernel of truth” for people to believe the falsehood that the 2020 election had been rigged. “It turns out that no matter how much proof there is that the election was done fairly, people are going to continue to believe the ‘Big Lie’ because it’s being constantly repeated by Trump and his allies,” said Hasen, who co-directs the Fair Elections and Free Speech Center at UC Irvine.“One would think in a real world, that even this fake audit, that was stacked in favor of helping Trump, that a finding in favor of Biden would have deflated the enthusiasm. And maybe it has among some,” he added. “But facts don’t matter when you’re incessantly lying about election integrity.”In the days since the final report was released in Arizona last week, Trump and his supporters have ignored its topline result. Instead, they have insisted the review backed up various conspiracy theories they have spent months advancing.Arizona state GOP Rep. Mark Finchem – the Trump-endorsed candidate for Arizona Secretary of State – claimed in an email to supporters over the weekend that Cyber Ninjas and its subcontractors had uncovered “red handed” evidence of fraud.He called for another audit, this time in Pima County – home to the state’s second largest city, Tucson. Biden won that county by more than 18 percentage points last November. Finchem also repeated his demand that the election results be decertified, although there is no process for doing so in Arizona. Finchem, who announced his run for Arizona secretary of state in March, has promoted QAnon conspiracy theories. He also attended the January 6 “Stop the Steal” rally in Washington. He has denied any involvement in the riot at the US Capitol. Trump wasted little time claiming victory as the report leaked out late Thursday last week. The former President released more than a half dozen statements over the next day and after the results were presented, attacking the media for correctly reporting that the review confirmed Biden’s victory and falsely claiming it was “a big win for us.” Trump continued at a campaign-style rally in Georgia on Saturday, where he once again attacked Georgia’s Republican leaders who had balked at his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.“It is clear, in Arizona that they must decertify the election, you heard the numbers,” Trump said. “It’s a disgrace. We won on the Arizona forensic audit yesterday on a level you wouldn’t believe.”In his written statements, Trump cited the report claiming 23,000 mail-in ballots votes were cast by voters from a prior address, which the Cyber Ninjas said may have had a “critical” impact on the election. But Maricopa County quickly debunked that claim on Twitter, writing that it was “legal under federal law.”“To label it a ‘critical’ concern is either intentionally misleading or staggeringly ignorant. AZ senators should know this too,” the county wrote.Before the release of the Cyber Ninjas’ review, election experts and Republican and Democratic elections officials in Arizona warned the findings should not be taken seriously. The Cyber Ninjas, a Florida-based company, had no experience auditing election results, and its leader has repeated wild conspiracy theories about election fraud. The company and its volunteers and subcontractors did not follow standard auditing procedures, and observers from Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs’ office repeatedly cited instances in which those conducting the review broke their own rules.That had not stopped other Trump-aligned Republicans from touting the audit. Earlier this year, Kristina Karamo, who is running for Michigan secretary of state with Trump’s support, toured the site of the Maricopa County ballot review. And, in July, months before Cyber Ninjas released its report, she described the review as demonstrating corruption in the state’s election system.Rep. Jody Hice, the Trump-endorsed House Republican in Georgia challenging the state’s Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, spoke ahead of Trump at Saturday’s rally in Perry, Georgia. Hice did not mention the Arizona ballot review, but he continued spreading the false claims about voting systems that Trump has clung to since the election was called for Biden in November and called for more audits. “We’ve got to deal with Dominion voting machines,” Hice said, a reference to the debunked conspiracy theories about voting machines in the state. “We’ve got to deal with the corruption that’s allowed. We’ve got to have audits.”Leaders of “audit” efforts in other key states also made the pilgrimage to Arizona in recent months amid the ballot review there.In Wisconsin – a presidential battleground that flipped from red to blue last November – a conservative former state Supreme Court justice Michael Gableman, is leading a GOP-ordered $680,000 taxpayer-funded election review. He visited the Maricopa ballot reviewsite over the summer. So have Republican lawmakers from Pennsylvania, another crucial swing state Biden won last year. Republicans in the state Senate there recently approved a wide-ranging subpoena for personal information about millions of voters as they work to advance their probe of election results in the Keystone State. Senate Democrats and the state’s Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro have sued to block the effort.Texas’ election audit of four counties, which the secretary of state’s office announced last week, is taking place in a state Trump won. But the announcement came after Trump wrote a letter to Abbott demanding an audit. While the secretary’s office stated that the “full forensic audit” was already underway, several counties told CNN last week they had not heard anything about it. Hasen, who recently wrote a paper warning of the risks of election subversion in 2024, said it’s “incredibly dangerous” that people who continue to promote the “Big Lie” are running to oversee future elections. “No. 1, it will further undermine people’s confidence in the process,” Hasen said. “And No. 2, someone who believes or purports to believe that the last election was stolen is more likely to act in a way to not conduct a fair election as a kind of payback for the supposed rigging the last time.” © 2023 Cable News Network.

101,,"South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in said on Monday there might be a need to prohibit dog meat consumption amid debate over the controversial practice and growing awareness of animal rights.While no longer as common as before, dog meat is eaten mainly by older people and is served in some restaurants and can be bought at specific markets.Moon made the remarks after being briefed by Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum on efforts to improve the handling of abandoned animals and a mandatory registration system for dogs. “After the briefing, he said time has come to carefully consider imposing a dog meat ban,” Moon’s spokeswoman Park Kyung-mee said in a statement.It was the first time that Moon raised a ban, which is likely to give fresh momentum to debate over whether to curtail the practice. Head of S Korean dog charity  secretly euthanized hundreds of animals To boost their popularity, several presidential hopefuls have pledged to ban dog meat in recent weeks, especially as dogs have become popular as pets and advocacy groups have urged South Korea to close down restaurants and markets selling dog meat.Lee Jae-myung, governor of the country’s most populous province of Gyeonggi and a leading presidential contender from Moon’s party, has vowed to push for a ban through social consensus.But Yoon Seok-youl, an opposition frontrunner, has said it was a matter of people’s personal choice.A poll commissioned by animal welfare group Aware released this month said 78% of respondents believed the production and sale of dog and cat meat should be prohibited and 49% supported a consumption ban.However, another survey by polling firm Realmeter found people were divided over whether the government should ban eating dog meat, though 59% supported legal restrictions on dog slaughter for human consumption.Dog meat sellers have insisted on the right to their occupation, saying their livelihoods are at risk. © 2023 Cable News Network.

102,,"The National Transportation Safety Board says it is reviewing on-board video as well as data from the “black box” of the Amtrak Empire Builder train that derailed in rural Montana on Saturday, leaving three dead and at least seven hospitalized.Eight cars from Amtrak’s Empire Builder train 7/27 traveling from Chicago to Seattle/Portland jumped the tracks around 4 p.m. near Joplin, Amtrak said. Joplin is about 30 miles south of the Canadian border, with a population of about 150 people.The train consisted of two locomotives and 10 cars and there were about 141 passengers and 16 crew members on board, the company said. Amtrak train derails in remote part of MontanaNTSB Vice Chair Bruce Landsberg says a team of 14 investigators and experts on the ground will review the train’s front-facing video as well as video from the same vantage point on a freight train that passed through the area almost an hour and a half prior.“We don’t know that this point whether it was a track issue or an issue with the train, so all of these things are open,” Landsberg said. “There’s a lot of ground to cover and there is significant damage so our experts are going to be really looking at that.”Landsberg says train data shows it traveling between 75 and 78 miles per hour before it departed a right-curving section of track where the speed limit was 79 miles per hour. Investigators will interview the train’s crew as well as BNSF Railway track inspectors who conducted an inspection where the train left the tracks. In a statement Sunday, Amtrak CEO Bill Flynn said the company was in mourning for those killed and injured.“We have no words that can adequately express our sorrow for those who lost a loved one or who were hurt in this horrible event. They are in our thoughts and prayers,” Flynn said. He said Amtrak is “fully cooperating with the investigation” and working closely with the NTSB, Federal Railroad Administration, local law enforcement and response agencies.“We share the sense of urgency to understand why the accident happened; however, until the investigation is complete, we will not comment further on the accident itself. The NTSB will identify the cause or causes of this accident, and Amtrak commits to taking appropriate actions to prevent a similar accident in the future,” the statement reads.Megan Vandervest, a passenger on a sleeper car on the train, had been taking a nap when the derailment jolted her awake.“I would describe the experience as kind of extreme turbulence on an airplane but louder, and there was kind of a lot of smoke smell. The first thought I really had when I woke up was, ‘Oh my God we’re derailing,’” she told CNN.“It was probably 10 or 15 seconds of rocking back and forth and tons of noise, and then we came to a stop. Really we didn’t know what was going on for a couple minutes.”Vandervest said she was evacuated within 10 minutes of the incident and only then understood the extent of the damage.“We kind of thought maybe the car behind us had slightly come off or something like that, but it ended up being much, much worse and a lot more jarring to see when we got off the train,” she said. “The car behind ours was slightly off and then the one behind that was kind of in between two sets of railroad tracks, and the one behind that one had like completely tipped over and fallen over and that was kind of the most shocking part.”Injured passengers were taken by ambulance to nearby towns, with those in critical condition flown for treatment, said Amanda Frickel, the disaster and emergency services coordinator for Hill County.Two patients remain hospitalized at Logan Health in Kalispell, according to hospital spokesperson Mellody Sharpton.“Both patients are doing well enough to be discharged soon,” Sharpton said. Casey Husted, vice president of communications at Benefis Health System in Great Falls, told CNN that five patients remain at their hospital. Husted told CNN that “they are in stable condition, although some require ICU level care.”Gov. Greg Gianforte offered “thoughts and prayers” to the individuals impacted by the “heartbreaking event.”“In the face of tragedy, Montanans did what they so best,” Gianforte said at a news conference Sunday. He thanked the community at large for coming together, saying it was “an all of the Hi-Line effort.”The Empire Builder train travels between Chicago-St.Paul/Minneapolis and Spokane-Portland/Seattle, according to Amtrak’s website, and offers passengers a chance to “experience the rugged splendor of the American West.”“Traveling between Chicago and the Pacific Northwest along major portions of the Lewis and Clark Trail, the mighty Empire Builder takes you on an exciting adventure through majestic wilderness, following in the footsteps of early pioneers,” the website adds.© 2023 Cable News Network.

105,,"Tried meatless Mondays? How about black fly Fridays or scorpion Sundays? New York City-based chef Joseph Yoon started cooking insects four years ago for an art project. He now wants to change our perceptions of creepy crawlies so that we can have “delicious,” “nutrient-dense,” and “sustainable” insect diets.“I absolutely love insects,” says Yoon, who is the executive director of Brooklyn Bugs, an organization that promotes edible insects. “The fact that they are so diverse, the fact that there are so many species of insects, the fact that we rely so heavily on insects for our own ecosystem and biodiversity is absolutely fascinating.”There are more than 2,100 types of edible insects in the world, and they come in varying flavors, such as nutty, citrusy, cheesy and coconutty, says Yoon. “What I’m trying to do is present people with this wonderful cornucopia of flavors, textures and ideas of how to cook with edible insects.”Insects are regularly consumed by an estimated 2 billion people, according to a 2013 report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). However, the report says that feelings of disgust are associated with eating insects in most Western countries. Feeding the world is an increasingly difficult challenge. Land is scarce and oceans are overfished, yet current food production will need to almost double to accommodate the 9 billion people that are expected to populate the Earth by 2050, according to the FAO report.Bamboo has been used for thousands of years in Asia. Now, it could help solve construction s sustainability problemAnd food production is taking its toll on the environment. Recent studies show that the livestock industry generates between 14 and 17% of manmade greenhouse gas emissions. Crickets need six times less feed than cattle, four times less than sheep, and half the feed needed by pigs and broiler chickens to produce the same amount of protein, according to the FAO. Protein-rich insect diets could provide a sustainable solution if Western attitudes towards them can change from “ew” to “yum.”To help reduce the environmental impact of our culinary habits, Yoon wants “to normalize edible insects around the world, particularly right here where I live in America.” But even for those who are willing to try, it’s not always obvious how best to incorporate insects into their diet.“When people ask me how they should integrate crickets or insects into their food, one of the favorite ways I like to do it is simply in my favorite foods,” Yoon says. “You don’t have to think about making a new dish with a new ingredient but if you like to make fried rice like I do, I love making fried rice with crickets. I love adding crickets to my mac and cheese. You can add the cricket powder to the cheese sauce.”He follows in the footsteps of other insect innovators trying to change Western attitudes. Among the early adopters, in 2012 American entrepreneur Patrick Crowley introduced an insect-protein product to the United States, the Chapul Cricket energy bar, which was fortified with cricket flour. An edible insect farm, Next Millennium Farms, opened in Canada in 2014. Dying to be green: Are mushroom coffins the secret to an eco-friendly death?In 2019, about 9 million people in Europe consumed insects and their derived products, according to the International Platform of Insects for Food and Feed. It forecasts that figure will be 390 million consumers by 2030.“When you think about insects – quite possibly one of the smallest organisms that we can think of … can one bug make a difference? Can one human make a difference?” Yoon says.“One of the really big driving factors of my work is that, yes, each one of us has a responsibility. Incorporating edible insects into your diet once a week can make a big difference.” © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

107,,"Stewart “Stu” Rasmussen, America’s first openly transgender mayor, has died, according to the current mayor of Silverton, Oregon, Kyle Palmer.Rasmussen died Wednesday “after a number of weeks under home hospice care for metastatic prostate cancer,” Palmer said in a Facebook post.HHS  Dr. Rachel Levine sworn in as US  first openly transgender four-star officer“His longtime love Victoria (Sage) noted that ‘he went bravely into the unknown on his own terms,’” Palmer said.Rasmussen, a lifelong resident of Silverton, the town he served as mayor over multiple terms, was 73 years old, according to the Statesman Journal newspaper.Rasmussen wasn’t concerned about pronoun usage and accepted both he/him or she/her, Sage told the newspaper.Rasmussen was first elected mayor in 1988 and was re-elected in 1990, before coming out as transgender, according to a Just Out magazine interview posted by the Victory Fund, a national organization dedicated to electing openly LGBTQ people. Rasmussen was elected mayor of Silverton again in 2008, this time as an openly transgender person, and remained in office until being unseated in 2014. That historic election sparked a protest by the Westboro Baptist Church, the Statesman Journal reported. The group is known for its virulently anti-LGBTQ protests at public events, including military funerals. LGBTQ Rights Milestones Fast FactsBut the Westboro protesters “were met by a large crowd of demonstrating citizens – many of them wearing dresses – supporting Stu and demanding that they leave town,” Palmer said.“He set an example for members of our community who needed to see that it was safe to live their lives openly in our community,” Palmer added. “My thoughts are with Victoria, as she faces life without Stuart for the first time in many decades. I’m comforted in the knowledge that he is no longer in pain.” © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

108,,"The US Embassy in Kabul is instructing personnel to destroy sensitive materials as well as items “which could be misused in propaganda efforts,” according to a management notice sent Friday to embassy staff, seen by CNN and described by another source familiar. The notice about “Emergency Destruction Services” underscores the dire situation on the ground in Afghanistan as cities continue to fall to the Taliban. The militant group controlled half of the country’s provincial capitals, including the second-largest city of Kandahar, as of Friday. A diplomatic source told CNN that one intelligence assessment indicated that Kabul could be isolated by the Taliban within the week, possibly within the next 72 hours, but stressed that does not mean the militant group would enter the capital.On Thursday, the Biden administration announced it would withdraw American personnel from Embassy Kabul, leaving only “a core diplomatic presence.” Thousands of US troops are being deployed to Kabul and the region to assist with the effort, which comes weeks before the American military was set to fully withdraw from Afghanistan.President Joe Biden spoke with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Friday “about the ongoing efforts to safely drawdown the civilian footprint in Afghanistan,” according to a White House tweet.In preparation of that effort, Friday’s embassy notice said facilities would provide “destruction support” daily and called on personnel to “please take advantage and reduce the amount of sensitive material on the property,” including papers and electronics.“Please also include items with embassy or agency logos, American flags, or items which could be misused in propaganda efforts,” it said.The notice said there would be a variety of means to destroy these materials, including burn bins, a disintegrator, an incinerator and a compacter and heavy-duty equipment.The State Department said that this was part of the standard procedure applied when minimizing the US footprint. “Drawdowns at our diplomatic posts around the world follow a standard operating procedure designed to minimize our footprint across various categories, including staffing, equipment, and supplies. Embassy Kabul is conducting their drawdown in accordance with this standard operating procedure,” a State Department spokesperson said.The situation on the ground is incredibly challenging for US diplomats, who say that plans are changing by the minute, one diplomat explained to CNN.The administration is also considering relocating the US Embassy from its current location in the capital to the Kabul airport, CNN reported Thursday, a further indication of the precarious security situation on the ground. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Friday that at this point, the Defense Department does not believe that Kabul is “in an imminent threat environment,” but he acknowledged that the Taliban appears to be trying to isolate Kabul.Blinken and Austin spoke with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Thursday to discuss the situation on the ground and the withdrawal of embassy personnel. The top US diplomat also had a similar call with his counterpart in Kazakhstan on Friday, according to State Department readouts. Despite the speed with which the Taliban has gained territory – a pace that caught US officials off guard – and accusations by the US and other nations that the group has committed atrocities that may amount to war crimes, the Biden administration has held firm to the decision to pull all US forces from the country. It has continued to call for a political solution to the decades-long conflict and have argued it is time for Afghan security forces to defend their own nation. Afghanistan s quick unraveling jolts national security officials and threatens to stain Biden s legacyThe Afghan Air Force has significantly increased the number of airstrikes it is carrying out against the Taliban, according to the diplomatic source, concentrating those strikes on the southern part of the country.In the past 72 hours, the Afghan Ministry of Defense claims on Twitter it killed approximately 1,000 Taliban militants in districts throughout the country, including the south.“They have an air force - a capable air force - which, oh by the way, is flying more airstrikes than we are every day,” Pentagon spokesperson Kirby said at a press briefing Friday. “They have the material - the physical, tangible advantages [over the Taliban]. It’s time now to use those advantages.”However, experts on the region and former American diplomats have said that Biden’s decision to pull US forces from Afghanistan regardless of the conditions on the ground, combined with government ineffectiveness in Kabul, have hampered the Afghan national forces’ ability to fight back. As the Taliban rapidly surges and American diplomats and military leave, many in Afghanistan have been left in a state of unease, fear and despair. There is particular concern among women, minorities, and those who worked for the US government – groups who now face repression and reprisal by the Taliban.The Biden administration said it will increase the pace of relocation for Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants and their families, but there are 20,000 applicants in the pipeline and thousands more who have worked alongside US organizations and don’t qualify for the SIV program.CNN’s Oren Liebermann, Ellie Kaufman, and Maia Noah contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/13/politics/afghanistan-embassy-72-scramble/index.html
109,,"The Biden administration is facing a “serious challenge” at the US southern border, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Thursday, saying the US has encountered an “unprecedented” number of migrants illegally crossing the border. During a news conference in Brownsville, Texas, Mayorkas stressed the sharp increase of migrants arriving at the US-Mexico border, many of whom are fleeing deteriorating conditions in their home countries.In July, US Customs and Border Protection apprehended 212,672 people, up from June and amid some of the hottest summer weeks – when arrests usually dip – and of those, 95,788 individuals were expelled. Twenty-seven percent had previously tried to cross the border, Mayorkas said, acknowledging that a Trump-era policy that allows border authorities to turn migrants away has contributed to people trying to cross the border multiple times. July marks the highest monthly number of migrants detained at the US-Mexico border in two decades.Customs and Border Protection also arrested 18,962 unaccompanied children in July, surpassing the number of apprehensions of minors in March, when overcrowded border facilities raised alarm among officials. While the administration has made inroads in moving children out of Customs and Border Protection custody, thousands remain in temporary facilities waiting to be reunited with sponsors, like a parent or relative, in the US.Since October, the US has encountered 845,307 unique individuals, compared with 796,400 during the same period in 2019, when there was a border crisis under the Trump administration.“We are facing a serious challenge at our southern border, and the challenge is of course made more acute and more difficult because of the Covid-19 pandemic. It has also been made more difficult because of the fact that the prior administration dismantled our asylum system,” Mayorkas said. The rate of positivity for Covid-19 among migrants is at or lower than the rates in local border communities, he said. Biden s immigration plan runs into on-the-ground realitiesThe administration has taken a series of actions to crack down on the flow of migrants to the US southern border. In recent weeks, the Department of Homeland Security has surged resources and personnel to the Rio Grande Valley, which has been overwhelmed by the number of arrivals, deploying Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to assist Border Patrol, bolstering medical staff, resuming a fast-track deportation procedure for migrant families and setting up flights to send people to other border sectors for processing.Earlier this week, Mayorkas traveled to Mexico with a US delegation to meet with officials. He cited the trip during his remarks Thursday, underscoring US coordination with Mexico on migration, including, for example, working with the country to increase interdictions. This month, the Biden administration started flying migrants apprehended at the southern border to the interior of Mexico to try to keep them from attempting to cross the border again. The practice has fielded criticism from immigrant advocates. “The Biden administration must stop using Trump’s cruel and illegal playbook,” said Eleanor Acer, senior director of refugee protection at Human Rights First, in a statement. “These expulsions are simply ludicrous from a public health perspective, and only confirm that the continued use of Title 42 has nothing to do with public health.”Last week, the American Civil Liberties Union, having hit an impasse in negotiations with the government, said it was heading back to court to challenge the administration’s continued use of a public health authority allowing the swift expulsion of migrants. The Biden administration has been caught between expressing compassion toward migrants and relying heavily on deterring those journeying to the US southern border. As a result, the border situation remains a political liability for the White House that is drawing criticism from both the left and the right.In an interview with CNN on Friday, Mayorkas listed a number of factors contributing to people fleeing their countries of origin, including decimated economies, extreme weather events and violence, as the US faces an overwhelming number of migrants at the US-Mexico border.“I think, really, we have to confront the fact that people’s desperation is so severe,” he told CNN’s Pamela Brown.The administration has also come under heavy scrutiny over poor conditions at some temporary facilities for unaccompanied migrant children that are overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services. The HHS inspector general recently launched a review of one of those facilities at Fort Bliss near El Paso, Texas.“The Department of Health and Human Services took swift action at Fort Bliss to address the conditions that the inspector general of that department reported,” Mayorkas said Friday.“If in fact there are any shortcomings in what the government does, when those shortcomings are brought to the government’s attention or when the government proactively identifies them because we are vigilant, we will address them swiftly,” he added. © 2023 Cable News Network.

All charges dropped!” Enonchong said Friday on Twitter. “We can retire the #FreeRebecca hashtag. So immensely grateful to all of you for believing in me and supporting me.”Enonchong was arrested and brought before a court in Douala, in Cameroon’s Littoral Region, on Tuesday, according to her lawyer and another close associate. She has been in government custody since her arrest, social activist Edith Kahbang Walla told CNN Thursday. Enonchong would later be accused of “contempt” and arrested according to a “verbal instruction” by the region’s attorney general, said Walla, who told CNN she was in direct contact with Enonchong.Enonchong is one of Africa’s most influential tech entrepreneurs and sits on the boards of many global corporations including the WHO Foundation. Her arrest sparked outrage on social media with many prominent individuals, including the French ambassador to Cameroon, calling for her release.After she was arrested, Walla said: “There’s no written complaint…no elements of the said contempt, there’s no warrant, there’s no summons.”“The Gendarmerie told (Enonchong) that they received a verbal instruction for her to be arrested. She was informed that the attorney general of the Littoral Region stated that in her discussions with members of his staff, she showed contempt,” Walla, who also leads the Cameroon People’s Party (CPP), added.Sylvain Oum, Enonchong’s lawyer, confirmed Walla’s comments. “We have received no documentation of what she (Enonchong) is accused of, nor formal written complaint against her.”“She is a victim of an abuse of power,” Oum said, adding that he believes Enonchong never should have been detained in the first place.According to Walla, Enonchong was referred to the Bonanjo Court of First Instance on Wednesday and was remanded in custody due to a delay in paperwork.Cameroonian authorities did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.The Cameroonian government has frequently been accused of repression and various forms of human rights abuses.The African Business Angels Network, which Enonchong co-founded, described her arrest as “highly irresponsible.” © 2023 Cable News Network.

111,,"An elementary school teacher in Northern California was hospitalized after being attacked by a parent during a verbal argument over the use of face masks, the district superintendent said.The sixth grade teacher was stitched up at the hospital for cuts and lacerations to his face sustained in a physical fight between a parent and the school’s principal on the campus of Sutter Creek Elementary School, about 45 miles east of Sacramento, Torie Gibson, Superintendent of Amador County Unified School District told CNN.School openings so far reveal science is right -- masking works“I absolutely will not tolerate violence,” Gibson vowed, calling the lack of respect for educators during this pandemic, “baffling.”On Wednesday, the parent arrived about 30-45 minutes after school hours to pick up his daughter who was in the school office with the principal. Both the girl and the principal were wearing face coverings, as mandated by a statewide health order, Gibson said. According to Gibson, the parent caught a glimpse of several vaccinated educators across the hall in the teachers’ lounge not wearing masks and became angry. Teachers are allowed to remove masks in the company of other vaccinated educators, according to a California directive. After a verbal argument between the student’s father and the principal over masks, in which the parent allegedly called the situation a “conspiracy” and claimed children “are being treated like animals,” the parent left the campus. A short time later he returned without his daughter and again engaged in an argument with the principal, Gibson said. When the situation escalated, a male teacher stepped in to try to settle the dad down, but a physical fight ensued.Parents clash at mask mandate protest in Georgia county where 5th graders were sent home Sutter Creek Police officers were called to the scene and were told it was a “disturbance between a parent and a staff member concerning COVID-19 procedures and facial maskings.”The student’s father was not arrested at the scene, but police are investigating. Police did not immediately respond to CNN requests for additional comment.“As sad as it is, I’m not shocked this happened. People are tired of mandates and being told what to do,” said Gibson, adding that she respects parents who advocate for their children. Gibson sent a letter to parents on Thursday regarding the situation and said that, “assaulting a staff member will never be tolerated on any school campus, and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent” of the law.“Remember, we are not the ones making the rules/mandates,” she wrote. “We are the ones required to follow/enforce them if we want to keep the doors open and the students at school five days a week.”The district has not publicly identified the parent but is seeking a restraining order against him that would prevent him from stepping foot on the school campus, while still allowing him to remain in his car to pick his child up from school.© 2023 Cable News Network.

 Theme parks are back, and that’s good news for Disney, which on Thursday reported better-than-expected earnings and a return to revenue growth for the first time in five quarters. The company brought in $17 billion in sales, up 45% from same period last year. That’s a bit higher than Wall Streets’ expectation of $16.8 billion, and the news sent shares up 4% in after-hours trading.The company reported earnings of $995 million in the third quarter, a significant improvement from the $4.8 billion loss posted this time last year.This was the first quarter that all of Disney(DIS)’s global theme parks have been open since the start of the pandemic, allowing the company to resume some semblance of normalcy. The parks, experience and products division brought in $4.3 billion in the third quarter, up from $1.1 billion in the same quarter last year. Disney+, which carried the company through the pandemic as parks remained closed and operated at limited capacities, grew to 116 million subscribers in the most recent quarter, exceeding the 112 million subscribers Wall Street analysts expected. At the end of May, the company reported slower subscriber growth than expected, mostly because of increased vaccination rates and relaxed Covid regulations that got people out of the house again. Since then, the platform released “Black Widow” and “Jungle Cruise” through its Premier Access Function, which gives subscribers the opportunity to watch movies on Disney+ the day they’re released in theaters for an additional charge of $29.99. The movies brought in $60 million and $30 million respectively via Disney+ alone.The company is currently grappling with a lawsuit from Scarlett Johansson, who starred in “Black Widow.” In the lawsuit, Johansson alleges that Disney breached her contract by simultaneously releasing the film on Disney+ and in theaters.As Delta variant cases continue to surge, especially in Florida, it’s unclear how the company’s theme parks will be affected. Disneyland Paris in July began requiring guests to present proof of vaccination, a negative PCR test result or a positive antigen test proving they have already been infected with Covid before they can enter the park. The company remains “bullish” about its parks’ recoveries and continues to see “really strong demand for our parks,” Bob Chapek, Disney’s CEO, said on a post-earnings call with investors and analysts Thursday.Disney has implemented a reservation system at its parks to manage capacities and improve guest experiences. Reservations have now surpassed third quarter attendance levels, Chapek said.The company anticipates all of its parks will be fully staffed again by the end of 2021.

 Editor’s Note: Henning Gloystein is a director of Energy, Climate and Resources at Eurasia Group, based in London. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. 
 Energy shortages and price spikes are roiling markets around the globe. The situation looks especially dire in Europe, which is facing industrial shutdowns, and in China, where there have already been blackouts.If winter heating demand spikes, the crisis is only going to get worse. There will likely be more disruptions, in which governments will prioritize households over industry. This means they will order energy-intensive businesses to reduce output or even temporarily shut down to save energy for homes. The economic damage will be significant, as will the potential for political backlash. This continued risk of supply disruptions and high prices for fossil fuels — which drive up electricity costs — are a signal to countries that it’s time to invest in clean and domestic energy resources. Politicians from Beijing to Brussels are aware of this. As a result, the current gas and coal supply crisis will accelerate, not slow, the green energy transition.That’s not to say, however, that the gas industry has no role to play, or that renewables are without problems. It will take years, perhaps decades, until renewable power capacity can be fully backed by storage solutions like clean hydrogen. Until then, gas is a better partner to the planet than coal-fired power stations. Coal meets just over a quarter of the world’s primary energy demand but is responsible for nearly 40% of global carbon dioxide emissions. The share of natural gas is only slightly smaller than coal’s, at about 23%, but the industry only emits about half the CO2 emissions of the coal sector. Gas is a relatively low-polluting and reliable energy source that can support renewables during the clean energy transition.In China, the government has launched an ambitious program to switch household heating from coal to gas to reduce pollution. The UKhas been one of the most successful major economies in switching to gas and phasing out coal, reducing its share from about 40% of electricity generation about a decade ago to almost zero today.Both policies are laudable for reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The problem is that the gas and renewable industries struggle to fill the supply gap left by coal that has been phased out of power systems. Most industrialised countries have similar plans to phase out coal, and many governments plan to use more natural gas in the coming years. The problem for governments to solve will therefore be how to act on climate change while ensuring affordable and reliable energy access.In the short term, any country or region wanting to engage in a green transition must diversify natural gas supply and expand storage capabilities. This can be done by developing a mix of pipeline gas and shipped liquid natural gas imports, or by signing long-term import deals with a large and diverse group of suppliers around the world to protect the importer from disruptions. Longer term, the investment focus must be on zero emissions technologies, like solar and wind backed up by clean hydrogen, large-scale batteries to store electricity generated from renewables, pumped hydro-storage facilities and new nuclear power reactors. All of these technologies already exist.Sky high natural gas prices will hurt low-income Americans the most this winterOther technologies include steel made with clean hydrogen, which replaces coal to fuel furnaces; synthetic fuels not made of petroleum, but from hydrogen or biomass like wood pellets, waste paper or agricultural waste; and technology to capture emissions before they reach the atmosphere, known as carbon capture and storage (CCS), which would allow fossil fuels to continue operating since their greenhouse gases would be prevented from entering the atmosphere. Despite a sense of climate urgency, there is some time get to zero emissions. Even the more ambitious policies to reach zero greenhouse gas emissions target 2050. But until these technologies are affordable and available at scale, governments must ensure they don’t neglect the remaining need for fossil fuels — especially natural gas.Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

But the Pro does include a fingerprint sensor located in the power button.The company is also bringing back the HDMI port, SD card slot, and a MagSafe charger, the last of which was removed when Apple introduced USB-C ports to the line.The new 14-inch MacBook Pro model starts at $1,999 and the 16-inch MacBook Pro model starts at $2,499.Apple introduced an update to its entry-level AirPods that offers features of the AirPods Pro line.AirPods 3 comes with spatial audio, better sound quality – providing more powerful bass and crisp high frequency – and is sweat and water resistant for workouts. It also comes with a new contour design and adaptive EQ, a feature previously found only on AirPods Pro. The wireless earbuds customize sound in real time by adjusting frequencies based on what your ear is hearing.The latest model touts improved battery performance, promising up to 6 hours of battery life, and 5 minutes of charge time will get an hour of use. Apple is also adding MagSafe and wireless charging to the case.AirPods 3, which are available for pre-order starting today, cost $179, while AirPods 2 are now $129. AirPods Pro will remain at $249 and its over-the-ear headphones, AirPods Max, cost $549.The company is adding a splash of color to its HomePod mini line. In addition to black and white, HomePod mini will soon be available in orange, yellow and dark blue for $99 each, starting in November.Meanwhile, Apple Music is getting a voice plan with Siri integration. For about $5 each month, subscribers can ask Siri to pull up playlists, songs and radio stations. The voice-only option is cheaper than its existing plan $9.99/month and the Family Plan at $14.99/month.Although Apple previously teased new features coming to macOS Monterey back in June, it never formally revealed a launch date until now. The latest Mac software, which includes updates to FaceTime, support for AirPlay, a low-power mode and a tab-grouping feature in Safari, will be available for download starting October 25.

 A bipartisan group of lawmakers warned Amazon on Monday they are concerned top executives including former CEO Jeff Bezos may have misled or even lied to Congress about the company’s business practices.The lawmakers, members of the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee, cited recent media reports that cast doubt on testimony provided by Amazon(AMZN) senior executives about how the company uses its vast influence to help its own brands.Elizabeth Warren says Amazon is  like a monster  that must be fed every minute“At best, this reporting confirms that Amazon’s representatives misled the committee,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. “At worst, it demonstrates that they may have lied to Congress in possible violation of federal criminal law.”The letter, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, was signed by Democrat Reps. Pramila Jaypal, David Cicilline and Jerrold Nadler as well as Republican Reps. Ken Buck and Matt Gaetz.The lawmakers said they are giving Amazon a “final opportunity to provide exculpatory evidence” to corroborate the previous testimony and statements on behalf of Amazon to the committee.Amazon executives have previously told lawmakers that the company doesn’t use the data from individual third-party sellers to inform the development of its own private brand products.“We strongly encourage you to make use of this opportunity to correct the record and provide the committee with sworn, truthful, and accurate responses to this request as we consider whether a referral of this matter to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation is appropriate,” the letter said.The letter cited testimony given in 2019 and 2020 by founder Bezos, associate general counsel Nate Sutton and written remarks provided by general counsel David Zapolsky and vice president for public policy Brian Huseman.In a statement, Amazon defended its executives’ testimony to Congress.“Amazon and its executives did not mislead the committee, and we have denied and sought to correct the record on the inaccurate media articles in question,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. The lawmakers pointed to a Reuters investigation that used a trove of internal Amazon documents to show how the company ran a “systematic campaign of creating knockoffs and manipulating search results” to help its own product lines in India, one of its largest growth markets. The report found Amazon’s private brands in India exploited internal data to copy products sold by other companies and then offer them on the Amazon platform.Amazon has called this Reuters report “incorrect and unsubstantiated” and reiterated that it “does not give preferential treatment to any seller on its marketplace.”Another report last week, from The Markup, found Amazon “places products from its house brands and products exclusive to the site ahead of those from competitors — even competitors with higher customer ratings and more sales, judging from the volume of reviews.” Storage containers are scarce, so toymakers are focused on small, squishy toys for the holidaysAmazon said in response to The Markup report that it does not favor store brand products through search and “strictly prohibits” its employees from using non-public, seller-specific data to determine which store brand products to launch.“We have an internal policy, which goes beyond that of any other retailer’s policy that we’re aware of, that prohibits the use of individual seller data to develop Amazon private label products,” Amazon said in a statement. “We investigate any allegations that this policy may have been violated and take appropriate action.”The pressure from members of the House antitrust subcommittee comes days after Senator Elizabeth Warren doubled down on her call for Amazon to be broken up. The Massachusetts Democrat told CNN that Amazon uses its power to “smash little businesses before they ever get a foothold” and likened the company to a “monster that has to be fed every minute.”CNN’s Seth Fiegerman contributed to this report.Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

119,,"It was a bad week for the Big Lie – former President Donald Trump and his allies’ false claims that widespread fraud is to blame for his 2020 election loss. In one battleground state, Republican senators issued a report that eviscerated Trump’s lies about voter fraud. In another, a judge undercut Trump’s supporters’ hopes to examine nearly 150,000 mail-in ballots. And one of Trump’s closest allies, Rudy Giuliani, was suspended from practicing law in New York. Trump and his conspiracy-minded supporters have eagerly been anticipating the conclusion of the problem-plagued audit of Maricopa County’s results in Arizona, but regardless of its final report, it will have no impact on the 2020 election results, as the election was already certified. Trump repeated his election lies at a rally in Ohio Saturday night, but last week’s blows underscored the reality that their options to continue contesting the 2020 election are narrowing. In Michigan, the Republican-led state Senate Oversight Committee said in a report released Wednesday that there was “no evidence of widespread or systematic fraud” in the state’s 2020 election. The report included a stinging condemnation of the lies about voter fraud pushed by Trump and his supporters. “Our clear finding is that citizens should be confident the results represent the true results of the ballots cast by the people of Michigan,” the committee, chaired by Republican state Sen. Ed McBroom, said in its report. “The Committee strongly recommends citizens use a critical eye and ear toward those who have pushed demonstrably false theories for their own personal gain.”Then, in Georgia on Thursday, a judge dismissed most of a lawsuit that claimed fraudulent mail-in ballots had been cast in Fulton County, the state’s largest county, in last year’s election – a blow to the pro-Trump plaintiffs’ bid to conduct an in-person examination of nearly 150,000 mail-in ballots with high-powered microscopes.The judge dismissed seven of the lawsuit’s nine claims against Fulton County officials, only allowing the plaintiffs’ request for digital images of the ballots under the state’s open records law to move forward. Biden won the state by 12,000 votes, and Georgia officials have already audited the 2020 results three times, including a hand recount. “Last year, I told President Trump and others who push the Big Lie to ‘put up or shut up.’ It’s been six months and no proof of wrongdoing has been produced. Enough is enough – this whole circus must end,” Robb Pitts, the chairman of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners, said in a statement. The same day, Giuliani, who had been Trump’s personal lawyer and one of Trump’s closest allies in advancing lies about the 2020 election, was suspended from practicing law in New York state by an appellate court that found he made “demonstrably false and misleading statements” about the 2020 election.In a ruling released following disciplinary proceedings, the court concluded that “there is uncontroverted evidence” that Giuliani, the former Manhattan US attorney, “communicated demonstrably false and misleading statements to courts, lawmakers and the public at large in his capacity as lawyer for former President Donald J. Trump and the Trump campaign in connection with Trump’s failed effort at reelection in 2020.”Giuliani’s “conduct immediately threatens the public interest and warrants interim suspension from the practice of law,” the court wrote.Trump has railed against the actions that challenge his lies about the 2020 election. He attacked his political opponents on Saturday in front of an Ohio crowd that chanted “Trump won” and issued statements last week riven with more falsehoods. Targeting Michigan’s McBroom and state Senate Republican leader Mike Shirkey, he included both senators’ phone numbers in a statement that said: “Call those two Senators now and get them to do the right thing, or vote them the hell out of office!” In another statement, he complained about the Justice Department’s Georgia lawsuit: “Actually, it should be the other way around! The PEOPLE of Georgia should SUE the State, and their elected officials, for running a CORRUPT AND RIGGED 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION—and for trying to suppress the VOTE of the AMERICAN PEOPLE in Georgia.” Of Giuliani, he said: “Can you believe that New York wants to strip Rudy Giuliani, a great American Patriot, of his law license because he has been fighting what has already been proven to be a Fraudulent Election?” Another important moment could come when the results of the so-called audit ordered up by state Senate Republicans and conducted by Cyber Ninjas – a Florida-based company with no experience auditing elections, led by a chief executive who had advanced Trump’s lies about voter fraud on social media – are released. The Twitter account for the audit tweeted Friday night that “paper examination and counting are finished today.” And the individual hand count which looked at two races, the 2020 presidential and US Senate contest, finished days ago, according to Arizona audit spokesman Randy Pullen.But the Arizona Senate Republicans have not stated when their report will be released. “Everybody is anxiously awaiting the result!” Trump said in a Wednesday statement. That, though, was another falsehood. Trump’s most ardent supporters are awaiting the report on the audit’s findings – which is likely to be delivered first to state Senate Republicans, who would then determine how to release it. However, experts in conducting and auditing elections and observers of Arizona’s proceedings have repeatedly said that the Cyber Ninjas’ methods are deeply flawed and could easily introduce errors into its final tallies. Those problems have made the audit’s findings more likely to be used as a propaganda tool by Trump’s supporters than a document that is taken seriously outside the “Stop the Steal” movement – a rallying cry adopted by Trump and his supporters.Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat who is running for governor, has maintained a list of problems that observers on the floor of the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix have noticed. Among the recent updates: “insecure cybersecurity practices” used by Cyber Ninjas; misplaced ballots; and auditors writing directly on the original labels on Maricopa County’s ballot boxes, which Hobbs’ document notes “violates the agreements and questions the reliability and integrity of all the county records.” The legal battles and audits are only one front of the ongoing fight over the 2020 election. In Republican-led states, including Florida, Georgia and Iowa, GOP lawmakers and governors have already enacted new laws that will make voting more difficult. Republican lawmakers in Michigan, Arizona, Texas and other states are also advancing restrictive voting measures. President Joe Biden’s Justice Department said Friday it is suing the state of Georgia over its new restrictive voting law. The state law imposes new voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, empowers state officials to take over local elections boards, limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to approach voters in line to give them food and water.Republicans had cast the measure as necessary to boost confidence in elections after the 2020 election and Trump’s repeated and unsubstantiated claims of fraud, but Democrats in the state have called the new law voter suppression and likened it to Jim Crow-era voting laws.“These legislative actions occurred at a time when the Black population in Georgia continues to steadily increase and after a historic election that saw record voter turnout across the state, particularly for absentee voting, which Black voters are now more likely to use than White voters,” Justice Department Civil Rights Division leader Kristen Clarke said in a news conference. “Our complaint challenges several provisions of SB 202 on the grounds that they were adopted with the intent to deny or abridge, Black citizens, equal access to the political process.”Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, issued a defiant statement in response to the department’s announcement, calling the lawsuit “born out of the lies and misinformation the Biden administration has pushed against Georgia’s Election Integrity Act from the start.”Kemp accused the administration of “weaponizing the US Department of Justice to carry out their far-left agenda that undermines election integrity and empowers federal government overreach in our democracy.” © 2023 Cable News Network.

121,,"Editor’s Note: Fatima Goss Graves is president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center. Sean McGarvey is president of North America’s Building Trades Unions, a labor organization representing more than 3 million skilled craft professionals in the United States and Canada. The views expressed here are the authors’ own. Read more opinion on CNN. 
 Ever since the 10th grade, 26-year-old Briana Phillips has wanted a job in the trades. Since then, she worked her way through high school, into an apprenticeship and eventually into a career as a union ironworker with Local 44 in Cincinnati. The roadblock on her mind: consistent and reliable care for her three children.For most of her career, Briana would pay family members to watch her kids, but lining up schedules can be very complicated and inconsistent. She also tried traditional day care, but it’s not as simple as it sounds. Between dropping her kids off at day care and driving to and from her job site, she was late to work every day and unable to work enough overtime hours to offset the day care costs, especially given that day care center had a hard stop, while her job did not. She tried taking turns staying home with the father of her children, a fellow ironworker, but all that did was make them both miss out on earning pension credits determined by the number of hours worked. It all came to a head in the past two months and Briana joined the millions of women who left the workforce - unable to pursue the family-sustaining career she’s been working so hard for, for nearly a decade. Stories like Briana’s are familiar to families around the country. And as the White House and Senate negotiators flesh out an infrastructure plan, it’s precisely workers like her who are at risk of being left out of the improvements the plan has promised. A significant investment in care, including affordable access to high-quality child and elder care, would reach every American. But leaving behind that support would stunt the economic growth infrastructure spending could provide.On Thursday, President Joe Biden announced that he had agreed to a compromise deal with Republicans on infrastructure. While many of its details remain unknown, we do know it includes many critical investments for Americans: roads and bridges, public transit, broadband, water and power systems and more. But so far the deal leaves out Biden’s proposal to spend $400 million to bolster caregiving for aging and disabled Americans. Biden’s original infrastructure plan, which contained provisions to build and update energy-efficient child care centers, already fell short on raising the wages and benefits of child care workers. Now, the bipartisan deal seems to have limited funding for child care facilities even more with only a provision that eliminates lead water pipes.This bill is a win-win for Democrats and RepublicansMeanwhile, help for home care workers and working mothers like Briana who need access to affordable child care is expected to be folded into a separate bill, which Democrats will try to pass on their own through reconciliation, which requires a lower threshold of 51 votes (or 50 votes with the vice president breaking the tie). While Biden has said he wants both bills passed in tandem, Senate Republicans who agreed to the bipartisan deal are now threatening to back out in an attempt to stymie the reconciliation bill – leaving the future of both pieces of legislation hanging in the balance. It is critical to invest in care at the same time as we invest in bridges and broadband. The infrastructure plan outlined by the White House this week is significant and holds a lot of promise for our economy. But without another corresponding bill that addresses the care infrastructure workers like Briana count on to be able to do their jobs, that promise will come up short.The pandemic has revealed that our reliance on the underpaid and undervalued caregiving work of women, and particularly women of color, places an unsustainable burden on those women, their families and the economy overall. Yet even before the pandemic, working people who most need access to these vital supports were least likely to have it. It’s not enough to go back to where we were. How the  guilt gap  is hurting American womenWe can’t expect an equitable recovery without addressing the lack of child care, home- and community-based services and paid leave that pushed millions of women out of the workforce and devastated their families’ financial security. Individuals, corporations, philanthropies and “the market” cannot solve this crisis. We need significant investment, especially at the federal level, to build an economy that works for all of us. Right now, we should be worried about spending too little, not too much.The path forward to shared prosperity is through public investment in infrastructure in all its forms. Expanding access to child and elder care while keeping costs affordable and paying the workers who provide it equitably will require significant federal investment, dollars which would best be spent by expanding home- and community-based services and adopting key provisions of the American Families Plan, including universal child care and universal paid leave. These must remain a top priority for this White House and this Congress if the full benefits of this infrastructure package are to reach every American. The Biden-Harris administration and Congress must continue championing bold and meaningful investments in our nation’s care infrastructure. A comprehensive plan to support caregivers is not only one of the best ways to ensure that our communities can prosper, but enjoys strong bipartisan support among the American public. Investing in care infrastructure will create good jobs that will support millions of people in the short and long term, as the pandemic begins to recede and as the population ages and our need for care grows ever more dire. Robust public investments in care will also ensure that our economic recovery will be equitable, including for Black women, immigrants, people with disabilities and others whose labor has been undervalued and dismissed for far too long. For millions of workers like Briana, this struggle over caregiving is not new. While the pandemic has highlighted the fragility of our country’s care infrastructure, returning to that inequitable and unstable status quo would be a grave disservice to workers, families and the entire economy. We have a rare moment to build a new future for workers and families, and it’s up to Congress and the President to seize it.© 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

122,,"North Korea claims it successfully test-fired new long-range cruise missiles over the weekend, according to the country’s state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).The report, dated Monday, says the country’s Academy of Defense Science successfully test-fired the missiles on September 11 and 12, and that the weapons had been in development for two years. The weapons demonstrate “another effective deterrence means for more reliably guaranteeing the security of our state and strongly containing the military maneuvers of the hostile forces against the DPRK,” the agency said, using the acronym for North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The US and neighboring South Korea are looking into the launch claims, officials in both countries told CNN.“Cruise missiles are often detected after the tests are conducted for their low flight altitudes. North Korea had conducted two cruise missile tests already this year, but we did not disclose them as we do not disclose all cruise missile tests we detect,” a South Korean Defense Ministry official also said.The North Korean launch announcement comes just as South Korea’s top nuclear envoy heads to Japan to discuss North Korea with US and Japanese officials on Monday and Tuesday. China’s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, is scheduled to visit South Korea this week as well. The US military’s Indo-Pacific Command said it is aware of reports of cruise missile launches from North Korea, and that the US is working with allies and partners.“This activity highlights DPRK’s continuing focus on developing its military program and the threats that poses to its neighbors and the international community,” the Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement.Multiple UN Security Council resolutions have expressed concern about North Korea’s ballistic missile program. However, such resolutions have not focused on the development or testing of cruise missiles.Unlike ballistic missiles, cruise missiles are propelled by jet engines. Much like an airplane, they stay closer to the ground, making them harder to detect. Most cruise missiles are not designed to carry nuclear warheads, either.However, this missile test was the most significant from North Korea since US President Joe Biden took office in January.According to KCNA, the new missiles traveled for 7,580 seconds along oval and figure-eight flight orbits in the air above the territorial land and waters of North Korea and hit targets 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) away.“This is a system that can reach targets throughout Japan,” said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies who specializes in open-source intelligence, “whereas the system we saw in March was a shorter range system just to target South Korea.”Lewis was referencing a series of North Korean missile tests earlier this year where Pyongyang test-fired a missile that flew 450 kilometers.“It’s a technical achievement for them,” Lewis told CNN, but added that the test was “totally expected.”“It was very clear they were going to test something, and this was clearly on the list,” he said.North Korea’s earlier test launches this year were widely seen as attempts to send a message to the Biden administration about the isolated country’s importance in the region. North Korea has shown off new and untested weaponry in its military parades over the last few months. The US anticipated that some of this would eventually be tested in a show of strength by North Korea and its leader, Kim Jong Un.The North Korean leader’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, had warned last month that the country would respond to joint military exercises between the US and South Korea, which would “face a more serious security threat” for ignoring repeated warnings against the drills.Late last month, the US also approved the sale of $258 million of precision guided munitions and related equipment to South Korea.And South Korean media reported last week that the South Korean Navy tested-fired a ballistic missile from a submarine for the first time. The country’s Defense Ministry declined to confirm or deny those reports.CNN’s Yoonjung Seo in Seoul and Joshua Berlinger in Hong Kong contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/12/asia/north-korea-missile-launch-new-intl/index.html

 From one end of the supply chain to the other, the UK’s food producers have endured a summer of trouble. “The cold stores didn’t have enough space to hold our crops, so we had to throw away a week’s worth of production,” explains Iain Brown, vice chairman of East Scotland Growers (ESG). “And we’ve not had enough workers to harvest our vegetable crops, meaning they are going to waste.” While food shortages have been common in many countries over the course of the pandemic, Brown believes that one issue unique to the UK is making life extra painful: Brexit. According to Brown, the two essential prongs of production – first, getting fresh food out of the ground, and then distributing it onto supermarket shelves – are both taking a hit due to a lack of workers. First, a lack of truck drivers, who take fresh items like cauliflowers to and from freezing facilities, meant that the ESG cooperative at one stage had to throw away a week’s worth of production, at an estimated cost of £1 million ($1.4 million). Second, Brown says that many of the seasonal workers, who would come from countries like Romania and Bulgaria for a few months to harvest vegetables, are now in short supply.“Some didn’t come because the Covid regulations make it too hard; some came, made a lot of money, and went home earlier than planned.” This, Brown says, meant about 10-15% of his crop went to waste, costing around £200,000 ($277,000).It seems that the consequences of Brexit are finally being felt up and down the UK. And far from the sunlit uplands promised by members of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government, a shortage of European workers in these vital areas means financial losses for businesses and empty shelves as the UK hurtles towards Christmas.The shortage of truck drivers is probably the most immediate issue. The current driver shortage is estimated to be between 90,000 to 120,000, according to a spokesperson for Logistics UK. While Brexit is not entirely to blame, the fact that the UK no longer has easy access to European drivers has created a headache for the industry. These people cannot simply be replaced by British workers. Besides the fact it can take up to nine months to qualify as a driver and cost up to £5,000 ($6,940) according to Logistics UK, Brits are not lining up to take these jobs. “We have an aging workforce in the UK and the image of working conditions for lorry [truck] drivers – unsafe parking spaces or places to rest up – has made it unattractive for lots of younger people,” a spokesperson for Logistics UK told CNN Business. This creates a hard choice for companies: What goods do you prioritize? If you have only one truck leaving your warehouse that day, you are probably going to prioritize perishables over things like bottled water. In the long run, this means less consumer choice and the possibility of consumer panic, as was seen in 2020 when Britain ran short on supplies of toilet paper.For some idea of how serious a problem is, the bosses of Britain’s biggest supermarkets have described the food shortages as unprecedented – one told The Times newspaper they were “at a worse level than at any time I have seen” – and warned that shelves could be bare at Christmas due to a lack of drivers. These shortages should be a gift for Johnson’s political opponents, who can say that his claims of having an “oven ready” Brexit deal in 2019 – the promise on which he won a general election – were false. The government, critics say, failed to adequately prepare for the inevitable consequences of Brexit and mitigate its initial impact. UK GDP growth ground to a near halt in July, according the Office for National Statistics, in part because of supply chain issues and worker shortages. Britain’s economy remains 2.1% smaller than before the pandemic, and some economists think the difference won’t be made up until the second quarter of next year.“Throughout the whole Brexit process the government found its efforts to get business and people prepared for the inevitable upheaval undermined by its need to present Brexit as something that would be positive for the UK and the economy,” says Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform. “This led to confusing radio adverts that didn’t even mention the word Brexit, delayed guidance, and last-minute changes of heart.” Worse, Johnson’s government is now in the strange position of refusing to implement a key part of the deal it once hailed as a great success. The UK was supposed to fully enforce a mechanism called the Northern Ireland Protocol later this year. The Protocol was agreed between the UK and EU to reflect the special status of Northern Ireland: Out of the EU, along with the rest of the UK, but sharing a soft land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state. Under the Protocol, goods can flow freely between Northern Ireland and the Republic, avoiding the need for a hard border – an essential measure in preventing a return to sectarian violence on the island. The UK agreed that it would in turn protect the EU’s single market by enforcing checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain.Doing so would effectively create a sea border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, something that would be very uncomfortable for Johnson, who likes to portray himself as an arch defender of the Union. It would also be anathema to the unionists in Belfast, who this week threatened to collapse the region’s fragile power-sharing arrangement over the issue.The last thing that Johnson, the man who led the Brexit campaign in 2016, wants to do is allow his opponents to claim that Brexit has not only cut Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK, but knowingly put additional pressure on both finances and stability in the region.This could explain why Brexit Minister David Frost said on Monday that the grace period allowing goods to flow from Britain to Northern Ireland would be extended, with no fixed end point. This, naturally, has allowed the EU, the long-time bogeyman of Brexiteers, to take the moral high ground, reminding Britain that the Brexit deal Johnson willingly signed is a legal treaty. These issues, while important, are far from the only post-Brexit embarrassments that make Johnson’s “oven ready” claims look a little silly. Despite assuring British fisheries they would not be hit by difficulties importing into mainland Europe, catches are being thrown back into the water, as boats are unable to land and process their fresh product in time for it to be sold. Lawmakers in Johnson’s own party have been receiving phone calls from constituents angry that they have been unable to get their goods into Europe because of Brexit. “They know we can’t do anything in a lot of instances. The government’s websites are not very helpful and they simply are not getting the help they need,” one lawmaker on the government payroll previously told CNN. “It’s difficult. They are angry that people are canceling orders and that I personally cannot get a French visa for them,” they add.And according to a Reuters report this week, Britain is “on course to lose its status as one of Germany’s top 10 trading partners this year for the first time since 1950,” citing “Brexit-related trade barriers” as the cause.All these difficulties were predicted by numerous critics of Johnson, as industry bodies lobbied the government for alternative arrangements to mitigate damage. Johnson has been repeatedly criticized by industry leaders and opponents for what they see as his reckless lack of preparation for Brexit. Despite this, Brexit’s fallout is not being used by Johnson’s political opponents, who are instead whacking him over domestic issues. But why?“The problem with these sorts of stories is they happen incrementally,” says Rob Ford, professor of politics at the University of Manchester. “One of the very tragic things about these stories is that in order for the public to really pay attention to them, something really dramatic has to happen. Unfortunately, that might be an overworked lorry driver crashing into a family car or children falling ill through malnourishment.”Until that point, Johnson can largely deflect the blame for these problems onto the pandemic. Ford notes this goes down well with his base of “Leave” voters, many of whom are sick of being told that Brexit was a disaster, and often willing to believe other explanations. But Brexit really is starting to bite. It was never going to be the case that the UK would immediately fall apart. But little by little, many of the assurances made in 2016 and during years of negotiations are cracking. Perhaps one day Johnson will deem it politically expedient to introduce greater mitigation against the downsides of Brexit. Yet even the timing of that is problematic: Admitting you need damage control means there is damage to control. And, given that much of Johnson’s political legacy will be defined by leading the campaign to “free” Britain from Brussels, the longer he can dodge criticism for not just Brexit as a concept, but his chosen implementation of it, the less his greatest accomplishment becomes a millstone round his neck.Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

126,,"With a reputation as a concrete jungle, few know that Hong Kong is one of Asia’s most biodiverse cities and boasts more hard coral species than the Caribbean. But these corals are under threat from pollution and rapid urban development. ArchiREEF, a spin-out company from Hong Kong University, says it has a solution: 3D-printed terracotta tiles designed to help corals grow and restore ocean life.Co-founded in 2020 by marine biology professor David Baker and PhD student Vriko Yu, the company hopes it can help make corals “more resilient” against climate change.Found in warm, shallow water, coral reefs cover less than 1% of the ocean floor but host more than 25% of marine life. Corals, invertebrate animals that live in vast underwater colonies that form reefs, have existed in Hong Kong for thousands of years, but pollution and coral mining have decimated the population. Baker and Yu have been trying to restore coral at Hoi Ha Wan Marine Park since 2016 in partnership with the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD).Hoi Ha Wan, now a protected coastal reserve, in the north of Hong Kong, used to be the site of coral mining for construction materials. This created a major barrier to restoration, says Baker as “the hard bottom of the seafloor has been mined away,” leaving only sand and rubble. The team needed to create a new “bottom” for the corals to grow on. Working with the university’s architecture department, they began developing an artificial coral reef using the university’s 3D printing facility. This artificial reef is made from tiles that are roughly two feet wide, and mimic the natural shape of platygyra, known as “brain coral.” Its twisting “valleys” attract marine life which can nest or hide from predators, says Yu.Once placed in the water, the team attach baby corals to the tile with non-toxic glue. The shape of the tile helps the corals grow upwards, attracting marine life that build their homes in the reefs.More than 130 of these tiles were installed on the seabed in Hoi Ha Wan Marine Park in the summer of 2020, and archiREEF was born.The 3D-printed tiles are just one small part of archiREEF’s business model. After engaging corporate clients and governments to sponsor a restoration project, archiREEF will identify a site for restoration, install the reef tiles, and continue to manage the site for up to five years, monitoring the growth and the biodiversity of the reef.Conventional artificial reefs, such as submerged concrete structures, often replace the function of the coral as a habitat for marine life, says Yu, whereas archiREEF wants to provide a “foundation” for the coral to grow on. Eventually, the coral will be strong enough to support itself without the tile – which can then be shattered by divers, or will naturally erode.Baker says that archiREEF can help regrow coral in areas where it has entirely disappeared, a situation which is becoming more common: scientists predict that warming ocean temperatures and increasingly acidic waters may destroy up to 90% of coral reefs globally in the next 20 years. Companies such as Australia-based Reef Design Lab and D-Shape have previously used 3D printing to create underwater habitats. But archiREEF’s use of clay, a non-toxic and natural material, is “innovative,” says Pui Yi Apple Chui, a coral restoration researcher at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Unlike concrete, clay is slightly acidic, like coral and has a similar chemical makeup to real reefs. The 3D printing technology also offers unlimited customization, which the architects at Hong Kong University say enabled them to create more places for the corals to grow and combat specific environmental problems with a bespoke design.Asia s  most sustainable bar  is rethinking waste in the drinks industryHowever, Chui also adds that people need to be “realistic” about restoration and consider the cost and accessibility of technology. Places like Hong Kong also need more data on the efficacy of conservation efforts before it can be scaled in a meaningful way, she says, adding: “Restoration should be the last resort; we should protect before we restore.” Rescuing these reefs can help sustain the planet’s underwater ecosystems, such as seagrass meadows, which benefit from coral reefs, and are important carbon stores. There are economic benefits to coral reefs, too. According to a 2021 report from the Global Fund for Coral Reefs, coral reefs support the lives of around one billion people through coastal industries such as tourism and commercial fisheries, as well as providing coastal defense from storms. ArchiREEF still has a way to go before scaling up. The team will observe the test site in Hoi Ha Wan for at least another two years to ensure the corals continue to thrive and survive natural disasters, such as typhoons. However, Yu says the results at the test site so far are promising: in the first six months of observations, four times more coral has survived on the clay tiles compared to conventional artificial reefs.A further 10 test sites are already planned, which the startup will use to refine the 3D-printing process and explore alternative materials, as producing clay is energy intensive and produces large amounts of carbon dioxide. While archiREEF’s focus is currently on government and large corporate clients, it hopes to one day engage individuals in its projects, too. “Restoration is currently restricted to conservation scientists,” Yu says. “But if we’re talking about stakeholders, it’s everybody.” © 2023 Cable News Network.

127,,"The House Select Committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot is poised to send notices to various telecommunications companies requesting that they preserve the phone records of several people, including members of Congress, multiple sources tell CNN. Preserving communications records is the first step in an investigatory process that could eventually lead to witness testimony. The notices are set to go out as soon as this week and provide the first window into the kinds of information the committee plans to pursue. Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, who serves as chairman of the Select Committee, has said that he hopes to issue subpoenas by the end of August. Thompson also has signed off on a broader investigative strategy that will serve as a guide for the panel’s work going forward, according to a source familiar with the planning document.While it remains unclear which members’ records the committee is interested in, several Republican lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, have acknowledged speaking to then-President Donald Trump by phone on January 6. Democrats have also accused some of their GOP colleagues of interacting with individuals who stormed the US Capitol prior to the attack.In an interview with CNN on Monday, Thompson confirmed the committee was poised to send letters to telecom companies but also indicated they would be sent to social media companies, though he declined to name which ones.“In terms of telecom companies, they’re the ones that pretty much you already know, the major networks, the social media platforms, those kinds of things,” Thompson told CNN on Monday.“I can tell you that we’ll look at everything that will give us information on what happened on January 6,” Thompson said. “We will look at all records at some point.”The Mississippi Democrat said the letters requesting that records be preserved have not gone out yet, but that there is a wide range of people who the Committee is planning to contact.“We have quite an exhaustive list of people. I won’t tell you who they are. But it’s several hundred people that make up the list of individuals we plan to contact,” he said.Jordan, who has said that he spoke to former Trump on January 6, told CNN on Monday that he had not been contacted by the committee to preserve his records, but said if he does he will comply.Lemon on Jim Jordan: Does this guy seem nervous to you?“I’ve got nothing to hide. I’ve said that along, I’ve nothing to hide,” Jordan, an Ohio Republican, said but then warned that should the committee take that step there could be political retribution. Much of the committee’s work so far has been behind closed doors, and the exact scope of the investigation remains unclear but there are signs it could balloon into a massive undertaking.The scope and purview of the committee’s work was part of what led to Republicans revolting over the concept of an independent bipartisan commission, but the select committee will likely be more expansive than the independent commission Republicans blocked in the spring.The resolution empowering the Select Committee provides no specific limitations as to what it can and cannot investigate, leaving it up to the Committee to impose its own guard rails and narrower focus.Initial plans involve compiling massive amounts of data, documents and eventually compelling testimony from a wide swath of potential witnesses, including members of Congress, former members of the Trump administration, and some of the hundreds of rioters who have been charged with assaulting the Capitol that day.It also appears that the Committee could have limitless resources. Though the group has yet to clarify how much it intends to spend, the flexible language dictating its funding mirrors the framework for the select committee investigating the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi. That committee ended up spending close to $7 million over two years.The committee kicked off its work on July 27 with an emotional public hearing featuring testimony from four front line law enforcement officers. No additional public hearings have been scheduled.To date, committee officials have offered few details about potential subpoena targets though GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and other members of the panel have made clear investigators must “get to every piece of information that matters.” That likely includes stitching together a detailed understanding of what Trump and his closest allies were doing that day and in the lead up to the attack. The Select Committee has also begun meeting with relevant agencies at the staff level, one of the sources familiar with the Committee’s investigation told CNN, another indication that the probe may finally start ramping up in the coming days and weeks. The panel has expressed an interest in speaking to former DOJ officials who have been linked to Trump’s effort to push false voter fraud claims. CNN previously reported it could seek relevant White House call logs from the National Archives, which has legal custody of all the presidential records from Trump’s time in office.Earlier this month, the Archives acknowledged to CNN that it has possession of the Trump-era call logs and other potentially relevant records from the previous administration. In March, the Archives received a letter from several House committees “requesting records related to the January 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol,” but it is unclear whether White House call logs were considered part of that specific ask.Still, the Archives noted that there is a process “by which the Congress and the incumbent administration may request access to records of former administrations.”The House committees that signed the March letter have been receiving documents on an ongoing basis from the Archives, according to two sources familiar with the process. Those documents, and other materials relevant to January 6, will be shared with the Select Committee which is now running point on examining all matters related to the attack, the sources added.

128,,"Afghans who have applied for special immigrant visas to the US were told to stay away from Kabul’s airport on Monday, as American officials ramped up evacuation flights and the Taliban said all US forces needed to leave by August 31. Western countries are now in a frantic race to complete what US President Joe Biden last week called “one of the largest, most difficult airlifts in history,” amid harrowing scenes at the airport of tens of thousands of people trying to flee Taliban rule.Amid the scramble to evacuate, many Afghans have essentially been pushed to the back of the queue. “We are currently prioritizing American citizens and legal permanent residents for entry,” John Johnson, public affairs officer for the US Embassy in Kabul, told CNN on Monday. “Due to a deteriorating security environment we are asking all others not to come to the airport at this time – the gates remain closed.”A source close to the situation at the airport told CNN that while current policy is to only let US and NATO citizens into the airport, they hoped to soon move to permitting applicants for the US’ Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program –an avenue for Afghans who worked for US forces and agencies to get out of the country – along with the US embassy’s local Afghan staff.US officials have emphasized that some SIV applicants are being “processed through the gates” and “considered for entry.” However, CNN sources on the ground say it is still not broad policy to let them into the airport.State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that locally employed staff were a priority.“Our locally engaged staff, they are absolutely a priority. They are absolutely part of our plans. And that commitment to them, to their safety and security, is something that is in no way diminished,” he said at a press briefing on Monday. Biden will face pressure from G7 to extend Afghanistan withdrawal deadlineThe change in policy at the airport comes as the US has sought to massively ramp up its mission. Some 10,400 people were evacuated from Kabul between Sunday and Monday morning, according to a White House official. It’s the largest number in a 24-hour period to date and the first time the administration has exceeded its target of 5,000 to 9,000 daily evacuations. Dozens more US military transport jets were expected to land at the airport Monday.Since the end of July, the US has relocated 42,000 people out of Afghanistan, Army Maj. Gen. William Taylor said at a Pentagon press briefing. This includes 37,000 people evacuated since August 14. G7 leaders are planning to press Biden hard on extending his August 31 deadline for US troops to withdraw from Afghanistan during a Tuesday virtual meeting. Biden has not publicly committed to such a move, worrying some allies who have pushed for an extension and fear there won’t be enough time to get their citizens and Afghan allies out.Biden indicated on Sunday that discussions were underway about the potential for remaining in the country longer, but the Taliban signaled on Monday that they view the August 31 date as firm. “August 31 is the deadline announced by them. The US must adhere to removing troops from Afghanistan by this date. Otherwise, it will be a clear violation,” spokesman Sohail Shaheen told CNN on Monday. He said that if there was a delay, “our leadership will take proper and necessary decisions.”After that date, Shaheen said those who wanted to leave “can do so through usual way of using commercial flights and having proper documents like passports and visas.”UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said that British efforts to evacuate people from Kabul “are really down to hours now, not weeks,” and forces on the ground must use every moment they have to get people out.The UK has evacuated a total 6,600 people since August 14, and over 8,000 since April, Wallace told UK broadcasters. But he said people should be honest with “the reality, which is we won’t get them all out.”The number of people in and around the airport awaiting evacuation swelled to around 20,000 over the weekend, but had been reduced to around 13,000 on Monday, a source familiar with the situation told CNN. Most of them are Afghans, the source said, adding that the number of US citizens at the airport was now in the low hundreds. The airport was increasingly chaotic in terms of who was allowed in, with special forces – Afghan and American – looking out for their former Afghan colleagues. “It’s quickly becoming the Wild West,” said the source. “[Special] operators are pulling people through gates left and right.”Even with the new flight restrictions, thousands of Afghans, mostly military aged males with “no documentation,” remained on the airport grounds, the source said. They had arrived on the second day during the “everyone gets in” lapse in filtering entrants.The source said there were “no plans to kick people off the airport,” potentially leaving thousands in limbo.One reason for the chaos was the decision to issue electronic visas, without names or document numbers, to SIV applicants. The visas were then copied as screenshots and sent by Afghans to thousands of other Afghans who were not eligible for access to the airport, a source told CNN at the weekend.“I don’t think consular, or the administration frankly, realizes how badly they f*****d up by sending that stupid visa and letting everyone in for 24 hours straight,” the source said Monday.Dozens more military planes were due to arrive on Monday. Plans called for 33 US Air Force C-17s to head to Hamid Karzai International Airport in the next 24 hours, said the source. Each of the large four-engine jets has the ability to take 400 passengers out of Kabul, “which should make a decent dent” in the number of people stuck at the airport.Meanwhile Monday, Japan joined the list of countries sending military transport aircraft to Kabul. Katsunobu Kato, Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, said one Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) plane would go to the Afghan capital on Monday, with more expected in the coming days.On Sunday, conditions at the airport worsened throughout the day, with its entry gates for the most part closed. There were instances of families being split up and sent to different countries in the chaos.“I don’t know what they were doing, but there is still local staff struggling at the gates and not even being able to get in,” a source close to the situation told CNN, referring to Afghans employed by the US.Families were being separated and sent to different countries, the source added. This was “not by design and not really the fault of US officials, but they’re either choosing to come in separately, or getting separated on the way in,” they said.“They’ve had cases where mom, dad, and children all end up in different countries,” said the source.The chaos continued on Monday morning, when sniper fire killed a member of the Afghan security forces helping secure the base, one source told CNN. The affiliation of the sniper was unclear, the source said.In the confusion, Afghan forces returned fire, but in the direction of some US Marines, who opened fire themselves, injuring four Afghans, the source said. The four are in stable condition and there were no US casualties. The Taliban hasn t captured all of Afghanistan yet. One province has vowed to resistAlmost 20 people are believed to have died from stampedes or gunshots around the airport in the past week.Seven Afghan civilians died in crushes near Kabul’s airport on Saturday, a spokesperson for Britain’s Ministry of Defense (MoD) told CNN. One crush took place outside the airport itself while another happened outside the Baron Hotel.“Conditions on the ground remain extremely challenging but we are doing everything we can to manage the situation as safely and securely as possible,” the MoD spokesperson said.The pace of evacuations from Kabul airport appeared to be picking up on Monday, with planes regularly taking off and long lines of evacuees waiting to board flights.One Afghan journalist, Qiam Noori, waiting to board a flight to Qatar, told CNN he had mixed feelings about leaving.“I’m lucky to leave,” he said. “But I’m also leaving a whole family behind, a lot of friends.”Noori believes the Taliban would have been unlikely to give him space to live freely. “This is the reality” of life in Afghanistan, Noori said, adding that his heart was already broken. In the 20 years since the Taliban were pushed from power, millions of Afghans embraced new benefits including increased access to education for women. Now the country’s future is getting on planes out of the country. As one evacuee at the airport told CNN on Monday, Afghanistan is witnessing a total “brain drain.”Nick Paton Walsh reported from Doha, Sam Kiley reported from Kabul, and Sheena McKenzie wrote from London.

129,,"The report detailing the findings of contractors who conducted Arizona’s sham “audit” of last year’s election results – which had been expected Monday – will be late because three of the five members of the auditing team have tested positive for coronavirus, the state’s Republican Senate leader says.Cyber Ninjas Chief Executive Officer Doug Logan, whose firm was hired by the Republican-led Arizona Senate to audit the 2.1 million votes cast in Maricopa County in 2020’s presidential race, and two other members of the five-person audit team tested positive “and are quite sick,” Senate President Karen Fann said in a statement. Logan and other members of his team were often seen during the recount process without masks. It is not clear whether those who tested positive had been vaccinated. CNN reached out to Cyber Ninjas requesting comment.Elections experts in both parties have said for months that results of the “audit” – pushed for by Republican lawmakers and conducted by the Florida-based company, which had no experience auditing election results and whose chief executive, Logan, has repeated wild conspiracy theories about election fraud – will not be credible.Fann said senators are receiving “a portion of the draft report” Monday but did not detail which portion and what will be left out. Fann also said senators want the envelopes that contained ballots mailed in last year included in the final report – but got the images of those envelopes from Maricopa County too late.“In addition to the illnesses, it wasn’t until Thursday that the Senate received the images of the ballot envelopes from Maricopa County and are hoping to have those analyzed as soon as possible to incorporate those results into the final report,” Fann said in a statement. “The Senate legal team will meet Wednesday to start reviewing the draft report, and when the remainder of the draft is submitted, the Senate team will hold another meeting to continue checking for accuracy, clarity, and proof of documentation of findings. Once that is complete, the final report will be presented to the Senate Judiciary Committee and findings released to the public.”Last week, Maricopa County officials said they’d already sent the images to the Cyber Ninjas review team in the past and were simply resending them. Randy Pullen, a spokesman for the Senate-sponsored audit, told CNN that the ballot images would not be handled by Cyber Ninjas.The report was due to the Senate – but it could be weeks or months before its results are revealed to the public. Fann and a team selected by Senate Republicans planned to review the report.Ken Bennett, the Senate’s liaison with the audit team, said last week that a group will spend the following “days or weeks” verifying the report and “checking for accuracy.”Bennett said he wanted to “spread fact, not rumor,” that this would only be a draft report and it would not be made public. The Senate team could ask Cyber Ninjas for further clarifications of its findings.“Senate team will then review for accuracy and clarity for final report which will be released publicly,” Fann, a Republican, tweeted last week. Bennett told CNN on Monday that he expects there to be an “adjustment to how the meeting will be conducted on Wednesday,” when the Senate’s legal team will review the partial draft report. He did not know the specifics, or whether Logan may brief the Senate’s legal team via videoconference or phone instead of in person.Once the audit team delivers the full draft report, Bennett expects the review process to take “several weeks” before the report is made public.The company and its volunteers and subcontractors did not follow standard auditing procedures. Observers from Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs’ office have repeatedly noted instances in which those conducting the audit have broken their own rules. And the partisan nature of the audit and its funders – $5.7 million came from outside, conservative sources, compared with just $150,000 from the state Senate, which ordered the audit – has long cast serious doubt on its credibility. No matter the results of the audit, the reality that Joe Biden is president and won Arizona’s 11 electoral votes last year will not change. But that hasn’t stopped former President Donald Trump and his allies – particularly far-right, pro-Trump propaganda outlets – from claiming otherwise and saying that other states should follow Arizona’s lead in conducting audits. Trump issued a raft of false statements ahead of a campaign-style rally in the state last month, and used the rally to repeat those lies.“Does everybody here understand that the 2020 election was a total disgrace?” Trump said.Trump’s allies have tried to export Arizona’s audit to other states – including Pennsylvania, where a state senator has sought to conduct his own review of individual counties’ results but has been rebuffed by those counties, and Wisconsin, where Republican lawmakers are looking into several approaches but have butted heads over which avenues to pursue.The finalization of the audit – and the potential for the report detailing its results to soon become public – has led Republican and Democratic elections officials in Arizona, including GOP officials in Maricopa County, to warn that it should not be taken seriously. Hobbs, the Arizona secretary of state and a 2022 Democratic candidate for governor, issued a 46-page report pre-butting the audit’s results, too. “It is clear that any ‘outcomes’ or ‘conclusions’ that are reported from the Senate’s review, by the Cyber Ninjas or any of their subcontractors or partners, are unreliable,” Hobbs’ report says.The report calls the Senate-run recount “secretive and disorganized.” It reiterates most of the issues Hobbs has cited for months: lack of security, shifting processes for screening and counting ballots, chain of custody and transparency problems. Over and over the report notes there were no consistent procedures in reading, tallying and storing the ballots. One person working to examine the paper in the ballots complained that the process changed “every day, every day!”In one example, a Senate contractor told observers that after one week, scanning of the paper ballots “had been abandoned because contractors performed a software update which resulted in the loss of all the ballot images.”Stephen Richer, the Maricopa County recorder – a Republican whose 2020 victory was one of the GOP’s few gains in the state, as they lost the presidential race and a Senate seat – released a 38-page letter titled “Dear Arizona Republicans” last week. In the letter, Richer, who has become an outspoken critic of the Cyber Ninjas audit, details his own political history as a loyal Republican who voted for Trump and explains the missteps the auditors and Senate Republicans who hired them have taken that led him to respond forcefully – including disproven allegations of criminal wrongdoing posted on a Twitter account run by the audit team.Richer notes that three post-election partial audits of Maricopa County’s results found them to be accurate. He also said he would still be willing to conduct a review of the 2020 election to ease Republicans’ worries, and would do so with Fann and GOP lawmakers – if they ditched Cyber Ninjas. “What I’m not willing to do is further indulge the biased, inexperienced, incompetent, conspiracy-theory-driven, unscrupulous, partisan Cyber Ninjas,” Richer said.He wrote that the audit “is an abomination that has so far eroded election confidence and defamed good people.”© 2023 Cable News Network.

132,,"The rapid Taliban victory in Afghanistan has provided a boost to extremist groups and terror networks and hastened an intelligence vacuum that US officials are now scrambling to fill.For months, US intelligence agencies had been preparing for what would inevitably be a reduced intelligence gathering operation in the region, given the withdrawal of US and allied forces from Afghanistan. But the sudden collapse of Afghanistan’s government has prompted US intelligence agencies to move some resources to the region from elsewhere, according to two sources familiar with the matter, in an effort to try to make up for capabilities they view as key to detecting plots that could affect the US at home or its interests abroad.One example is moving predator drones with more endurance into the area to try to mitigate the loss of bases in the country, said one of the sources.Adding to the complexity, some anti-government and right-wing extremist groups in the US may also be drawing inspiration from the Taliban’s victory, officials say. “We are assessing what’s the long-term impact on decisions made regarding the repositioning of troops,” one US law enforcement official told CNN.Afghanistan withdrawal will likely dismantle a CIA intelligence network built up over 20 yearsIn the short term, ISIS and al Qaeda will likely be focused on local and regional activities. Both groups have affiliates in Africa, Yemen and Syria. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday that the threat of ISIS in Afghanistan is “acute” and should be taken seriously as the administration rushes to evacuate thousands of US citizens and Afghan allies from Kabul. “The threat… is something we are focused on with every tool in our arsenal,” Sullivan told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on “State of the Union.”One recent illustration of the threat came over the weekend as evacuation efforts at the Kabul airport were hampered because of threats just outside the airport gates from the local ISIS affiliate, President Joe Biden said.On Monday, Sullivan said that Biden “has been clear from his perspective that American terrorism capabilities have evolved to the point where we can suppress that terror threat without keeping thousands or tens of thousands of troops on the ground in a country.”Longer term, the worry is that Afghanistan could eventually devolve into a safe haven from which terrorists can recruit, train, launch attacks, and also maintain media operations to inspire attacks in the US.The US law enforcement official says this could offer an opportunity for extremist groups to “engage more expansively on trying to inspire attacks, not necessarily manage them, but inspire them through their online activities.”The relationships between the Taliban and a number of al Qaeda figures go deep, and back many years, a former Department of Homeland Security official who worked on counterterrorism, told CNN. “Most of us assume that there will be only the lightest and thinnest of leashes that the Taliban will want to or be able to put over al Qaeda,” the former official said. The chaotic nature of the US withdrawal is “clearly going to embolden violent extremists all over the world,” the former official added. US intelligence officials in the coming months will be watching for signs of recruitment by al Qaeda and other groups that have a history of using Afghanistan and nearby areas of Pakistan as a base for attacks outside the region, including the US, Europe and India. “As we are approaching 9/11, for them to be able to reclaim Afghanistan, think about what that does for recruitment,” said one former US counterterrorism official.The National Counterterrorism Center noted in a recent report in recent days that terrorist groups from Syria to Pakistan have publicly celebrated US defeat in Afghanistan.Of particular concern are the hundreds of prisoners set free by the Taliban in recent days across Afghanistan. Michael Sherwin, a former Justice Department prosecutor who worked alongside Afghan prosecutors and judges in the country’s national security court, said the release of prisoners represents a boost of “hard core terrorists” into the ranks of al Qaeda and other groups.Sherwin recalled that even during trials, some defendants would make explicit threats to kill Americans and allies. “The magnitude of that impact won’t be completely realized for years,” said Sherwin, who also served as acting US attorney for the District of Columbia in the closing months of the Trump administration.Since the US withdrawal announcement earlier this year, US intelligence officials have acknowledged that senior al Qaeda leaders who fled to other countries, could return to Afghanistan, according to a source familiar with internal discussions at the time. Many of these leaders are believed to be part of the group’s command and control structure, the source added. In recent years, the growth of domestic threats from White nationalist and other right-wing groups has prompted US law enforcement to shift resources away from international terrorist threats. But FBI officials have said the international threat never went away.A recent Department of Homeland Security terrorism bulletin, issued days before Kabul fell to the Taliban, warned that 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks could serve as a catalyst for violence in the US. “[F]oreign terrorist organizations continue efforts to inspire US-based individuals susceptible to violent extremist influences,” the bulletin said, pointing to the recent release of Al-Qaeda’s first English-language copy of Inspire magazine in over four years.For US officials the immediate issue is dealing with the situation on the ground and making sure people who are being relocated from Afghanistan to the US are fully screened and vetted – systems and processes that have been upgraded over the years with Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the intelligence community. But that process is now being tested in a tense situation, requiring a surge of resources to comb through the thousands of people fleeing Afghanistan who face reprisals, even death, for working for the US.“Anytime something’s happening in a pressure cooker you’ll be pushed to accelerate processes that are sometimes deliberate for a reason because you can miss something,” a former Homeland Security official told CNN.Also of concern is the possible boost to non-Islamist domestic extremists. The reaction on white supremacist and anti-government online forums to the Taliban takeover has been a “little bit surprising,” the US law enforcement official said.“There are some significant discussions,” in which people are expressing support of what the Taliban has done and are looking at it as an example of what anti-government extremists should be doing in the US, the US law enforcement official said. Some of the narratives are focused on “the Taliban did it right” and that it should be a “lesson learned” for how we should operate in the US, the US law enforcement official said.“That’s got us a little concerned,” because it suggests an escalation in violence, the official added. For example, there were some references to the fact that only 80,000 Taliban were able to defeat an Afghan army of several hundred thousand supported by the US, the official said.There’s a mix of narratives surfacing online, including discussions portraying the Afghanistan withdrawal as how the US government, and particularly the Democrats, are undoing all the work that has been done by Americans who served in Afghanistan. Amid anti-immigrant sentiment, DHS officials are also in ongoing conversations about whether Afghans themselves will be targeted once they land in the US and are resettled here.“Will they be the potential target? Will Afghans themselves become targets?” the official said, noting a concern.CNN’s Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/23/politics/us-intelligence-vacuum-taliban-afghanistan/index.html

 Disney is releasing more details about the financial performance of “Black Widow” as the company pushes to have a lawsuit brought by Scarlett Johansson — the film’s star — go to arbitration.The company revealed in a court filing on Friday that the Marvel superhero film has made more than $125 million in streaming and online revenue as of August 15. The film, which was made available for purchase to Disney+ subscribers for $29.99 starting on July 9 — has also made more than $367 million at the global theatrical box office, according to the company.Disney included these figures in its motion requesting a confidential arbitration in New York rather than a public trial.John Berlinski, the attorney for Johansson, said in a statement to CNN Business, “Why is Disney so afraid of litigating this case in public?” “Because it knows that Marvel’s promises to give Black Widow a typical theatrical release ‘like its other films’ had everything to do with guaranteeing that Disney wouldn’t cannibalize box office receipts in order to boost Disney+ subscriptions,” he said. “Yet, that is exactly what happened — and we look forward to presenting the overwhelming evidence that proves it.”Daniel Petrocelli, the attorney for Disney and Marvel who put forth the filing on Friday, told CNN Business in a statement Monday that “we are simply asking the court to enforce the parties’ agreement requiring arbitration of all disputes.” Johansson filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court last month that alleged Disney(DIS) breached her contract by releasing “Black Widow” on Disney(DIS)+ on the same day it was released in theaters. This, according to the suit, reduced Johansson’s financial stake in the film because she had agreed that her salary would be based, in large part, on the film’s box office haul. Scarlett Johansson is suing Disney over  Black Widow  Disney+ releaseDisney responded by saying that “there is no merit whatsoever to this filing.” The studio added at the time that the company “fully complied with Ms. Johansson’s contract and furthermore, the release of ‘Black Widow’ on Disney+ with Premier Access has significantly enhanced her ability to earn additional compensation on top of the $20 million she has received to date.”Johansson vs. Disney has been a flashpoint in an evolving Hollywood. The lawsuit comes at a pivotal moment as the industry faces questions about how audiences will consume entertainment in the future, and how those who create it will be compensated.“Black Widow” brought in $80 million at North American the box office in its opening weekend. That was around what the industry was expecting and was also a record for the pandemic era. The film also made $60 million globally on Disney+ that weekend, according to the studio.

134,,"Rep. Dan Crenshaw says he is “hopeful and confident” in his recovery after undergoing emergency eye surgery earlier this month, but cautioned he has “a while to go.”“I can lift my head again and no longer have to position myself face down which is a relief. This is obviously good news, but it doesn’t mean we are out of the woods yet,” the Texas Republican wrote in a statement Friday.“I still cannot see much other than lights and shadows, basically, as I am still in the early stages of my recovery. I am not sure how my vision will be in a few weeks, but I am hopeful and confident that it will return to normal,” he continued.The congressman underwent emergency surgery at DeBakey VA Medical Center in Houston to re-attach his left retina. Crenshaw said Friday that surgeons put a “silicon buckle” around his retina and used a laser to “glue” around the retina’s edges.“When they did that, they needed to keep my retina in place, which is why they injected a gas bubble into my eye to act as a bandage for my retina and prevent further detaching,” he explained. “This is why I cannot see anything right now and won’t be able to see for the next few weeks until the gas bubble dissipates.”On his third deployment as a US Navy SEAL in 2012, Crenshaw lost his right eye after he was hit by an IED blast in Afghanistan. That blast also caused a cataract, excessive tissue damage and extensive damage to his left retina, he said. Crenshaw recovered and ultimately deployed twice more before he was medically retired in 2016.Crenshaw noted that he is unable to fly for at least six weeks, but will remain engaged on legislative issues. The congressman’s offices in Washington and Houston “continue to function as normal,” he said.“I am staying up to date on legislation in the House, but I still will not be posting on social media or conducting interviews for the time being,” he said.CNN’s Veronica Stracqualursi and Daniella Diaz contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/25/politics/dan-crenshaw-eye-surgery-recovery/index.html
135,,"Democratic Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri said she would refuse to vote for new policing reform legislation that compromises on civil lawsuit protections currently afforded to police officers, as negotiations on a federal police accountability bill are underway on Capitol Hill.“We compromise on so much. You know, we compromise, we die. We compromise, we die,” Bush told CNN’s Abby Phillip on “Inside Politics” when asked about the compromise on qualified immunity floated by Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina. “I didn’t come to Congress to compromise on what could keep us alive. … If you don’t hurt people, if you don’t kill people, if you are just and fair in your work, then do you need the qualified immunity anyway?”Bush was just one of several lawmakers to weigh in on the federal policing reform effort, signaling that the issue of so-called qualified immunity remains, for some, a sticking point in congressional talks. The House passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act last month without Republican support, but it faces an uncertain future in the narrowly split Senate with Democrats pushing to change federal law to ensure that police officers can be charged for “reckless” conduct, rather than “willful” misconduct under existing law – currently a higher bar to meet in court.Analysis: Optimism on police reform in the Capitol collides with anguish in the streetsStill, Democrats and Republicans said Sunday that they see hope for a compromise on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Rep. Karen Bass, a California Democrat who is leading the negotiations with Scott, said Sunday that a critical piece of reforming the system will be setting national standards to guide police conduct and the use of force. “We have 18,000 police departments and no national standards, which is why you see some practices legal in some areas and illegal in other areas,” Bass said on ABC’s “This Week,” adding: “We know that officers are trained to shoot to kill, but maybe much more emphasis could be placed on de-escalation – why some incidences result in people being killed. Maybe there were other ways to respond other than firing.”Bass said last week that she hoped she could work with Republicans to put together a framework before the one-year anniversary of the Floyd’s death on May 25. Scott last week floated his potential compromise on reforming qualified immunity, and has said some Democrats he has spoken with are open to it and he doesn’t believe Republicans are far apart on the issues. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Sunday that he believes there is a way to find compromise on qualified immunity. “We can solve the issues if there’s will to get there, and I think there’s will to get there on the part of both parties now,” Graham told Fox News’ Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday.” Bass said during a separate interview on the show she is willing to negotiate with her Republican counterpart on passing a bill, but stressed that “holding officers accountable is key.” A moment of justice, a sigh of relief, a lot more to do“I don’t know if I’m willing to blow up the deal, I don’t consider that blowing it up, but we do have to look at ways,” she told Wallace when asked if she would “blow up” the deal” if she couldn’t reach a middle ground with Republicans on qualified immunity. “Now if Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott can show us some other way to hold officers accountable because this has been going on for just decades.”Other Republican lawmakers also signaled Sunday they are willing to negotiate on police reform legislation. Florida Sen. Rick Scott suggested he is open to negotiating with Democrats on new standards for prosecuting or suing police officers, but said his priority is the protection of police officers and their ability to serve their communities. “I’ll always listen to everybody’s proposal,” Scott said in an interview with ABC. “But what I’m not going to do is put our law enforcement community in a position that they’ve got to second guess themselves when they’re trying to make sure people are staying safe.”West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” that she also supports the proposal put for by Sen. Tim Scott.“I think there’s a real – and it’s probably past due – but a real want to get this done and, I think, to get it done right,” she said. “But we’ve got to make sure that we are still recruiting in and have the possibilities of having what is a core, I think, function of our government, which is a law enforcement that protects us.”CNN’s Maeve Reston, Nicky Robertson, Manju Raju, Jessica Dean, Ted Barrett, Daniella Diaz and Aaron Pellish contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/25/politics/qualified-immunity-police-reform-bill-bush-capito-cnntv/index.html

 Although 2020 was rough for most companies — to say the least — some bucked the trend.The pandemic forced consumers to learn, workout, socialize and more in new ways. That boosted businesses using technology to improve remote access to their services, and condensed years’ worth of digital adoption into several months. Those business models could have staying power when the pandemic ends.“I think the habits that we have all formed over the past 12 months … are not going to go away,” said Jake Matthews, a senior intelligence analyst at CB Insights covering fitness technology. A lot is riding on the idea that people will keep choosing digital services as life returns to normal. Digital health, education technology and fitness technology startups, for example, raised record amounts of capital in 2020 — raking in a combined $41.4 billion in funding, according to CB Insights. In some cases, Wall Street has started betting against companies that flourished last year: both Peloton(PTON) and Zoom(ZM) toppled from their highs in recent months. Still, some strong performers from last year say they have an edge over in-person competitors now, and plenty of opportunity remains.Meal delivery service HelloFresh was just coming off a blockbuster quarter in which it added over a million new customers when the pandemic hit last year. Instead of the usual tempering of sales growth in the second quarter, HelloFresh’s orders surged.“There were lots of new customers flocking to our business,” USA CEO Uwe Voss told CNN Business, adding that existing customers also started ordering more frequently. The pandemic created the perfect conditions for consumers to try HelloFresh, which mails customers meal kits with recipes and precisely measured ingredients. Meal delivery was attractive as many shoppers were avoiding physical grocery stores and cooking novices could easily pick up a new hobby. Plus HelloFresh meals typically cost less than restaurant take-out.Before the pandemic, the company had expected sales to grow as much as 27% in 2020. Instead, HelloFresh ended the year with total sales up 107% after selling more than 601 million meals. Its shares are up 303% since January 2020.HelloFresh added 7,000 employees last year and three new US distribution centers to manage the growth. The company expects sales to normalize in 2021 as the pandemic subsides but still projects revenue growth between 35% and 45%, on top of last year’s surge.“Even after the pandemic, [it’s still] more affordable than going to a restaurant or getting takeout,” Voss said. “The food tasted good during the pandemic and it will taste good after the pandemic. It’s still a convenient way for you to do dinner.”To improve its value proposition, HelloFresh is expanding the number of meal kit options from its current roughly 25 choices per week. It launched also a “marketplace” this year, where customers can add sides or snacks to their meal orders.In November, HelloFresh acquired ready-to-eat meal company Factor75, so its customers can order meals that can be ready in minutes, in addition to the ones they have to prepare. Voss said the new offering appeals to different demographics — “more male households, more single households” — which will help with customer acquisition.“We believe it’s a very opportunity-rich space for us, and we can do a lot ourselves to create demand in the future,” Voss said. While gyms and fitness studios were among the pandemic’s biggest losers, at-home workout alternatives were clear winners.Peloton(PTON)’s sales doubled and stocks gained 420% last year. And Tonal, an at-home strength training system, says its unit sales increased by a whopping 800% in 2020.When the pandemic hit, “the at-home fitness category really took off in a boom,” Tonal Chief Marketing Officer Chris Stadler said.Tonal is a flatscreen TV-sized device with extendable, arm-like components that use electricity to create up to 200 pounds of resistance. It costs $2,995, including an accessory pack, with a $49 monthly subscription fee that covers all members of a household. Customers can take classes taught by live instructors, or do workouts designed by an AI “personal assistant.”Peloton is spending $100 million to reduce delivery delaysThe company’s fans include professional athletes: More than half of the NBA teams in last year’s “bubble” used Tonal devices to train. Serena Williams and Mike Tyson are among the company’s investors (last month, Tonal announced a new $250 million funding round).Even as gyms reopen, Stadler expects many people to remain permanent converts to at-home workouts.“I think people are seeing results more than [with] any other fitness activity” thanks to the AI personal assistant, Stadler said, adding that customers appreciate the convenience of exercising from home. More than two thirds of consumers who started using a virtual fitness program during the pandemic plan to keep using it long-term, CB Insights’ Matthews said. In March, Tonal opened 40 “mini shops” inside Nordstrom stores, nearly quadrupling its physical distribution points so more people can try the devices. The company also wants to replicate the social aspect of belonging to a gym. It launched a “partner workout” feature that lets users work out together, both in-person and virtually.“As more people start using Tonal, friends and family talk about it, [we expect] referrals will really increase,” Stadler said.The same collective boredom that led to society’s “Tiger King” obsession also pushed many consumers to find new forms of entertainment. That was a boon to online learning platforms like Skillshare, where subscribers can watch video lessons on everything from animation to marketing. Skillshare’s daily new users “took a heavy tilt in the right direction” in mid-March 2020 as Covid-19 spread, CEO Matt Cooper said. By June, the company reached its customer acquisition goal for the entire year.“Everybody ran out of Netflix,” Cooper said. “I think it was: ‘What can I do to get my mind off of what’s going on in the world at large?’ Or, ‘Hey, now’s a great time to invest in that thing I always wanted to learn.’” In late February of 2020, Skillshare kicked off a funding round that ended up totaling $71 million when it closed last summer — raising more than the company had initially planned to manage the unexpected growth.As the pandemic wore on, SkillShare noticed changes in the content users engaged with. Although the platform’s top performing videos typically focused on painting, photography and other fine arts, there was growing interest in mental wellbeing and anxiety relief. The company leaned in— shifting its messaging to highlight those offerings. Skillshare now has more than 13 million members and thousands of teachers making videos. While its explosive growth may moderate post-pandemic, Cooper doesn’t expect it to stop. The online learning market is set to grow from $200 billion in 2019 to $375 billion by 2026, according to research firm Global Market Insights. “We’re all eager to get out to restaurants and bars and trips and hotels, so I fully expect that we’ll see some of the engagement slow,” Cooper said. “But I think there have been fundamental changes that have occurred.” Skillshare’s 135-person team plans to remain fully remote even after the pandemic — a big cost savings and a testament to the permanent evolution. “Of course we’re going to start doing things in person again, but I don’t think we’re going to leave [behind] a lot of the benefits that we saw from going fully virtual, fully distributed and fully online,” Cooper said. As fear about the spread of Covid-19 set in last spring, many people tried out virtual healthcare (or “telehealth”) for the first time. That included services like Nurx, a platform where patients can connect with medical providers to receive prescriptions for birth control and other treatment.Demand for Nurx’s services skyrocketed — order volume for emergency contraception, birth control, sexually transmitted infection tests grew 40%, 50% and 100%, respectively. Its total sales climbed 80% year-over-year in 2020, according to CEO Varsha Rao.Thanks to the pandemic, “there’s more willingness and interest in adopting telehealth for all kinds of services,” Rao said. Amazon looks to expand its telehealth footprint As the world reopens, Nurx won’t just be competing with in-person medical providers — the digital healthcare space has also gotten more crowded in the past year. Even Amazon(AMZN) plans to expand its telehealth service.Nurx is adding new offerings to ensure continued growth. Since September, the company has launched treatment for migraines and acne and plans to add at least three more new services this year.“Patients are seeking care for important issues for them, but are often hard to access,” Rao said of Nurx’s 325,000 monthly customers. “There’s a shortage of dermatologists, there’s a shortage of neurologists, so these are areas where we can offer very high-quality care.”In May, Nurx raised $22.5 million in a Series C funding round to help fund the new offerings. The company also expects consumers to keep choosing the convenience of telehealth over resuming all doctor visits in-person. Experts agree — by 2023, virtual medical visits are expected to exceed face-to-face appointments, according to Gartner research.“The great thing is that telehealth has moved from being a second or third option for people to being a primary way that they want to seek out care,” Rao said.

137,,"As President Joe Biden looks to build momentum for police reform in his address to a joint session of Congress this week, there is some optimism in Washington about the potential for a bipartisan compromise that would finally create more accountability for law enforcement. But beyond the beltway, there is also deep frustration and anger in the streets of America as young men and women of color keep getting injured and killed by police.The murder conviction of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who killed George Floyd last May, demonstrated accountability in one case that was a cause for celebration among activists last week. But the troubling series of police shootings in the days that followed has underscored how one verdict will not produce the kind of transformational societal and cultural change that is needed to stop the disproportionate killings and injuries of Black and Brown people during encounters with police.Both the verdict and outrage about the recent incidents have created new energy behind the push for federal police accountability legislation, with both Democrats and Republicans saying Sunday that they see hope for a compromise on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Rep. Karen Bass, a California Democrat who is leading the negotiations with Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, said Sunday that a critical piece of reforming the system will be setting national standards to guide police conduct and the use of force. “We have 18,000 police departments and no national standards, which is why you see some practices legal in some areas and illegal in other areas,” Bass said on ABC’s “This Week.” She added that even if her legislation passes Congress, there will still be much work to do at the local level to prevent these all-too-common police shootings: “We know that officers are trained to shoot to kill, but maybe much more emphasis could be placed on de-escalation – why some incidences result in people being killed. Maybe there were other ways to respond other than firing.” What could Congress actually accomplish on police reform?Those questions about deadly force are fresh on the minds of Americans after the police shootings of the last week. Newly released 911 audio on Friday showed that 32-year-old Isaiah Brown, who is Black, was shot by a Virginia sheriff’s deputy early Wednesday while he was talking to a 911 dispatcher. An attorney for Brown’s family, David Haynes, said in a statement that Brown was “on the phone with 911 at the time of the shooting and the officer mistook a cordless house phone for gun.” The deputy has been placed on administrative leave while the incident is being investigated, but Virginia State Police told CNN Brown was unarmed. He has serious but not life-threatening injuries.The death of 16-year-old Ma’Khia Bryant, who was shot and killed by a Columbus, Ohio, police officer about 30 minutes before the guilty verdict was delivered in the Chauvin trial, has touched off protests and another heated debate over how officers could try to de-escalate conflicts before pulling their weapons. Body camera video of that shooting showed Bryant lunging toward another young woman with a knife when she was shot.And a new dispatch audio recording, posted to the archives of the website Broadcastify, captured the moments after Andrew Brown Jr. was shot and killed by deputies on Wednesday morning in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. First responders can be heard saying he was shot in the back. Details about that incident have been difficult to get and seven deputies were placed on administrative leave after the shooting, which occurred while they were attempting to serve Brown with an arrest warrant. Brown’s death has sparked both protests and widespread calls for the officers’ body camera footage to be released publicly, including from North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat. The district attorney for the region and the Pasquotank County attorney said in a joint statement Thursday that the body camera footage cannot be released without a court order.When considered together, the circumstances of the shootings illuminate the complexity of the nation’s problems with police training, systemic racism and the culture this nation has fostered in which police too often resort to the use of deadly force. At the same time demonstrators are demanding change, some Republican-led states are passing laws that would make protesters more vulnerable. For example, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican, signed a bill last week that grants immunity to drivers who unintentionally injure or kill protesters while attempting to flee a demonstration.A new Washington Post-ABC News poll finds that six in 10 Americans believe more should be done to hold police accountable for the mistreatment of Black people, while 33% say the US is doing too much to interfere with how they do they their jobs. But there was a sharp partisan divide on that finding: 85% of Democrats and 58% of independents said the country should do more to hold officers accountable for their mistreatment of Black people, compared with only 31% of Republicans. In part because of that political polarization, there is still broad disagreement between the two parties about how far Congress should go to punish police misconduct.The most recent shootings illustrate how the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act will only address some aspects of the problem, and would not necessarily have prevented any of the violence that unfolded last week. The bill has already passed the House, but has faced a more difficult path in the evenly divided Senate, where Democrats lack the votes to overcome a Republican filibuster. States tackling  qualified immunity  for police as Congress squabbles over the issue Still, there are new signs of optimism that Republican and Democratic lawmakers are serious about trying to make a deal. Bass says she hopes the two sides can put together a framework by late May, which would be the one-year anniversary of Floyd’s murder. Scott floated a potential compromise last week on reforming qualified immunity, arguing that police departments could be held accountable even if individual officers are still shielded. The South Carolina Republican has said some Democrats he has spoken with are open to his compromise and he doesn’t believe Republicans are far apart on the issues. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Sunday that he believes there is a way to find compromise on qualified immunity. “We can solve the issues if there’s will to get there, and I think there’s will to get there on the part of both parties now,” Graham told Fox News’ Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday.” But a number of progressive Democrats are voicing their concerns that Scott’s compromise on qualified immunity would not go far enough in holding police officers accountable. On Sunday, progressive freshman Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri questioned why police officers are entitled to a “safety net” – in the form of qualified immunity – when other professionals who deal with life-or-death situations do not have the same protection. “The safety net shouldn’t be there,” Bush told CNN’s Abby Phillip on “Inside Politics.” “Where are all of the special protections for nursing and for other people in other positions that do very dangerous work?”“We compromise on so much. You know, we compromise, we die. We compromise, we die,” Bush added when asked about the compromise on qualified immunity floated by Scott, which she doesn’t support. “I didn’t come to Congress to compromise on what could keep us alive. … If you don’t hurt people, if you don’t kill people, if you are just and fair in your work, then do you need the qualified immunity anyway?”Rep. Stacey Plaskett, a Democratic congressional delegate for the US Virgin Islands, explained the passion behind the progressive push to change qualified immunity during an interview with CNN’s Pamela Brown on Saturday night. “Qualified immunity has in many instances become the hood for bad police officers to, in fact, act as modern-day Ku Klux Klan members against Black and Brown people in this country. And it has got to stop,” Plaskett said. “The most conservative members of the Supreme Court say that Congress needs to do something about qualified immunity. And we cannot shirk our responsibility to victims and Americans at large because we are afraid of the unions, or talking points, or those on the right who have used the blue wall as a shield against American justice.”Meanwhile, Scott said he opposes Democratic efforts to lower the legal standard to prosecute individual officers, which Bass said is a key issue for Democrats, who are pushing to change federal law to ensure that police officers can be charged for “reckless” conduct, rather than “willful” misconduct under existing law – currently a higher bar to meet in court.Biden plans to make a push for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in his first address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, marking his first 100 days in office and laying out his priorities going forward. Newly confirmed members of his Justice Department are also taking a more active role on the issue.Attorney General Merrick Garland, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco and Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta met in person at the Justice Department, and virtually, with police chiefs from major cities and influential police leaders from around the country Friday to discuss ideas for police reform, according to a spokesman for the attorney general. Garland also announced last week that he was opening a federal civil investigation into policing practices in Minneapolis.Though the Biden administration has mainly taken a hands-off approach to police accountability legislation, suggesting that Congress should take the lead, Americans will be looking for answers from the new President Wednesday night on how he plans to stop these senseless killings.When asked by CNN’s Dana Bash in an interview whether she planned to get more personally involved in brokering a compromise, Vice President Kamala Harris implied that the onus is still on Congress. “We’ve made our position clear, each of us,” Harris said, referring to Biden and herself, “and as an administration we’ve made our position clear. But it is for the folks in the Senate to work together, to resolve whatever may be differences of opinion about the details of the legislation.”“I think there’s no question that the American people, in a bipartisan way, realize and want that there will be some reform of the system,” Harris added.Her comments once again underscored that it is not yet clear how much political capital the White House is willing to spend to help draw Senate Republicans on board to reach a compromise – and create a real chance for substantive change.This story has been updated with additional details Sunday.Chandelis Duster and Nicky Robertson contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/25/politics/joe-biden-police-reform-congress/index.html
138,,"One hundred and thirty-five years after the Statue of Liberty was formally unveiled in New York Harbor, her “little sister” has taken up residence in front of the French ambassador’s home in Washington, DC.The miniature Lady Liberty was officially inaugurated in a ceremony with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Wednesday, coinciding with France’s Bastille Day.“Liberté and égalité – they translate very easily into English, but there’s no single word in English – brotherhood, sisterhood, solidarity, fraternity – that I think perfectly captures the essence of fraternité,” Blinken said in remarks at the ceremony, referencing the French national motto.“But I think it’s fair to say that fraternité is the word that best defines the relationship between our people and our ongoing struggle to improve our democracies and advance the ideals embodied in the light that shines the world, at home and around the world,” he said. “So may she continue to remind us the principles we share and the work that remains to live up to them. And may we never be cured of yearning for freedom.”French Ambassador Philippe Etienne said “it means a lot” to have the statue in the United States, calling it “a strong reminder … of the friendship between the French people and the American people.”“It’s a reminder of the importance of this core value of liberty for the world,” he told CNN, noting that the formal title of the Statue of Liberty is “Liberty Enlightening the World.”The “little sister” is an exact replica of the original but is one-sixteenth the size. It was crafted from sculptor Auguste Bartholdi’s 1878 plaster model and stood on display at the National Museum of Arts and Crafts in Paris for a decade before beginning its journey to the US. Statue of Liberty Fast FactsIn early June, the 1,000-pound, nine-foot tall statue was uninstalled from the museum and placed “in a custom-designed plexiglass container specifically for our ‘little sister,’” according to Ed Aldridge, the President of CMA CGM North America – the company that handled the shipping and logistics for the statue.Aldridge told CNN they “took tremendous care and very detailed, thorough planning to make sure (they) did it right.”“We trucked her very carefully to Le Havre, France, where we put her on board one of our CMA CGM ships and then took her to New Jersey and then trucked her to Ellis Island, and then eventually we trucked her down here to the Ambassador’s residence,” he said. The statue was displayed near its world-famous “big sister” in New York City at the beginning of July, and Aldridge told CNN that they sped their ship up to get the statue across the Atlantic in time for Independence Day. Following the dedication on France’s national day, the statue will remain at the ambassador’s residence in the US capital for 10 years.

 “The United States should intervene militarily.” In less than one week, this kind of call to action was made relative to not one, but two, unfolding crises in the Western Hemisphere. In the immediate wake of the assassination of Haiti’s President Jovenel Moise, one of the country’s interim prime ministers, Claude Joseph, called on the United States to deploy troops to the western third of Hispaniola to secure critical infrastructure and enhance stability. Days later, as unprecedented crowds of valiant Cubans rose up across the island to protest the country’s decrepit, authoritarian regime and the lack of food and medicine amid an ongoing economic crisis aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic, some South Florida politicians formed a chorus calling on the United States to intervene militarily in Cuba.Will brute force work in Cuba -- this time?Although they undoubtedly thought they were acting boldly, those who made these calls were instead engaged in the ultimate tell that they had no idea what the US should do. Or that they were political grandstanding. Or both. There would have been no shame in silence on what the US should do. The situations in Haiti and Cuba are complex and immune to the kind of bold action people so desperately want when long-suffering populations, like Haitians and Cubans, are in such acute need of assistance. The desire among certain politicians in the US and Haiti for the US government to somehow sweep in and rescue people from economic and political depredation is undeniable, especially when the events in question are unfolding in the “US’ near abroad,” in countries where it has historically not hesitated to intervene. The hard, simple truth is the United States is not going to be the primary engine of political change in either Haiti or Cuba. Meaningful, durable political change in both lies in the hands of the populations themselves. That also requires time as the ability of those populations to set their respective paths forward is hampered, in the case of Haiti, by the legacy of a predatory state followed by an absent one and, in Cuba’s case, by the repression of a long dictatorship. There is no big-bang action from the United States that will remove either of those impediments. Instead, and although it feels profoundly frustrating in such urgent times, the path for US action is far more deliberate and patient. In the case of Haiti, the United States needs to send an unmistakable message to all who are looking to Washington to play kingmaker that those days are behind us. The burden of navigating an exceedingly complex political moment in which the country has only 10 legitimately elected officials is on Haitians. The United States – and other members of the international core group – can and should play a role in bringing the country’s political, civic, and private sector leaders together to chart a path to and through free, fair, and transparent elections. It should not seek to impose decisions on those actors. The US, together with key international partners, including Canada and the European Union, can and should also help alleviate the humanitarian situation in Haiti, especially as it relates to the vastly undercounted spread of Covid-19, according to experts. Helping foster political consensus and relieving some humanitarian burden should help Haitians forge a path forward and help avoid the humanitarian catastrophe that would be a maritime mass migration akin to those seen during Haiti’s last protracted political crisis in the early 1990s.Gloria Estefan: The world needs to put pressure on CubaIn the current environment, empowering the Cuban people to determine their own future feels perhaps even trickier. Those who believe a social explosion in Cuba is the only path forward are already trying to box President Joe Biden’s administration into further prolonging President Donald Trump’s misguided crackdown on Cuban Americans supporting Cubans on the island in the hopes the pandemic plus enforced family division will create enough pressure to bring down the regime.Although the end of the regime is the desired end-state, history tells us intense pressure on the island results in two outcomes only – maritime mass migration and/or a harsh clampdown on civic activity blamed on US policy. Neither of those outcomes is in the US national interest nor in the interest of the Cuban people. Despite political posturing by some in South Florida, the time is now for the United States to embrace an approach that engages and empowers the Cuban people, like the one that paved the way for the internet connectivity that allowed the images of the Cubans’ struggle to go viral, fueling the recent uprising. The US should extend a confident hand to the Cuban people in support of their fundamental rights and most basic needs and desires. Calls for action must be answered; wisely and always in service of US national interests, even if the means for doing so feel unsatisfactory in the moment. © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

140,,"FBI officials investigating allegations of sexual abuse by disgraced USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar violated the agency’s policies by making false statements and failing to properly document complaints by the accusers, resulting in a delay in the probe into the claims, the Justice Department’s inspector general said in a scathing report Wednesday. The Office of the Inspector General found that senior officials in the FBI Indianapolis Field Office failed to respond to the Nassar allegations with the utmost seriousness and urgency that they deserved and required, made numerous and fundamental errors when they did respond, and violated multiple FBI policies when undertaking their investigative activity. The probe was opened in 2018 to see whether the FBI and its field offices dragged their feet to respond to allegations of sexual assault made by gymnasts and the USA Gymnastics organization in 2015 and 2016. The release of the 119-page report comes a little over a year after more than 120 of the survivors asked the Justice Department to make the findings public.The bureau said in a statement that the “actions and inactions of certain FBI employees described in the report are inexcusable and a discredit to this organization,” adding that it has taken action to “ensure and has confirmed that those responsible for the misconduct and breach of trust no longer work FBI matters.” Nassar, 57, is serving a 40-to-174-year state prison sentence after 156 women and girls said he sexually abused them over the course of 20 years.READ: Justice Department inspector general report on FBI s Larry Nassar investigationThe former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University doctor pleaded guilty in November 2017 to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct for using his profession as a cover to sexually abuse his patients. Nassar also pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges and separate state criminal sexual conduct charges in Eaton County. “According to civil court documents, approximately 70 or more young athletes were allegedly sexually abused by Nassar under the guise of medical treatment between July 2015, when USA Gymnastics first reported allegations about Nassar to the Indianapolis Field Office, and September 2016,” the report reads. “For many of the approximately 70 or more athletes, the abuse by Nassar began before the FBI first became aware of allegations against Nassar and continued into 2016. For others, the alleged abuse began after USA Gymnastics reported the Nassar allegations to the Indianapolis Field Office in July 2015.”The report says Indianapolis Field Office Special Agent in Charge W. Jay Abbott and another unidentified supervisory special agent conducted a “limited follow-up” investigation in 2015 that included “a handful of email exchanges” and five pages of handwritten notes. The officials also neglected to interview two of the three accusers who were available for interviews, the report says. Josh Minkler, an attorney for Abbott, told CNN in a statement that his client has received and reviewed a copy of the report.“Mr. Abbott thanks the law enforcement officers and prosecutors who brought Larry Nassar to justice. Mr. Abbott hopes the courageous victims of Nassar’s horrible crime find peace,” Minkler said.The report also said that the Indianapolis Field Office “did not advise state or local authorities about the allegations and did not take any action to mitigate the risk to gymnasts that Nassar continued to treat.” The unnamed agent was demoted and his status with the FBI is pending review by the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility. Abbott retired in January 2018. “When the FBI’s handling of the Nassar matter came under scrutiny from the public, Congress, the media, and FBI headquarters in 2017 and 2018, Indianapolis officials did not take responsibility for their failures,” the report said. Instead, the agency “provided incomplete and inaccurate information,” and after Abbott retired he also provided inaccurate information to the media “to make it appear that the Indianapolis office had been diligent in its follow-up efforts and they did so, in part, by blaming others for their own failures,” according to the report.Douglas Leff, the assistant director of the FBI’s Inspection Division, said following the report’s release that the officials’ actions were “completely unacceptable.” During the eight months the FBI was supposed to be investigating the gymnasts’ claims, Abbott met with a high-ranking official with the USA Gymnastics organization at a bar to discuss a potential job offer with the Olympics security detail when he retired, according to the report. The FBI Los Angeles Field Office learned about the same allegations from the three gymnasts in May 2016, where it “appreciated the utmost seriousness of the Nassar allegations and took numerous investigative steps upon learning of them” but it, too, did not notify local authorities, the report says. “Simply put, the behavior described in the report is not representative of the FBI or of our tens of thousands of retirees and current employees,” Leff wrote in a letter Tuesday that’s included in the report. “To the extent the review reveals additional misconduct by FBI employees, we will similarly act promptly as warranted upon OPR’s adjudication.” John Manly, an attorney for more than 150 of the women and girls Nassar sexually abused, urged the Justice Department to criminally charge the agents who mishandled the investigation, saying in a statement on Wednesday that “those responsible need to be held to account, with all the force the law can provide.” “When an ordinary American citizen lies to the FBI in the course of an investigation, they are prosecuted, yet no charges have been filed against anyone as a result of this five-year investigation,” Manly said. “The FBI betrayed generations of Olympic champions. It betrayed the hundreds of children Nassar savaged, and it betrayed the American people’s trust.” Nassar is housed at the high-security US Penitentiary Coleman II in Sumterville, Florida. His release date, according to online Federal Bureau of Prisons records, is January 30, 2068.This story has been updated with additional details from the report and reaction.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/14/politics/larry-nassar-fbi-justice-department-review/index.html
141,,"Editor’s Note: Ron Reynolds is a Democratic state representative from Texas. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.
 I came to Washington, DC with over 60 Democratic colleagues on Monday with the intent of protecting the freedoms of Texas voters. We wanted to prevent the Legislature from achieving a quorum and voting into law a series of ruthless restrictions on voting for the state. So we left for our nation’s capital. In response, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has vowed to have us arrested as soon as we come back. But it’s time that our United States Congress hears from the front lines of the anti-voter movement – a movement driven by extremists seeking to essentially reinstitute the days of Jim Crow by attacking measures disproportionately used by voters of color – that is sweeping our nation.Just like racism and division, House Bill 3 and Senate Bill 1 – both seeking to suppress voters – have no place in Texas.This special 30-day legislative session Abbott called to vote on the bills has been poisoned from the beginning. It began with his defunding of the legislative branch late last month as punishment for Democrats walking off of the state House floor in May to prevent Republicans from passing Senate Bill 7 during the spring regular legislative session – causing the bill to expire. SB7 would have restricted voting on Sundays and allowed courts to use fraud claims to overturn election results. Gov. Abbott’s move is an abuse of power – an act of legislative coercion and a threat to democracy.After last-minute hearings last Saturday that lasted nearly 24 hours in the Texas House and Senate, we heard from hundreds across the state,and the vast majority cried out and asked us to stop HB 3 and SB1, which among other things, bans local election official from sending unsolicited applications to request mail-in ballots and bans drive-through voting and extended hours during early voting.Texas Republicans voted down every amendment that would have lessened the damage that would be wrought by these voting restriction bills. On a straight party vote in both chambers, Republicans moved to advance the bills.The record voter turnout during the 2020 election that delivered a victory to President Joe Biden has renewed GOP efforts to ensure that only certain people have access to the ballot box. Dozens of states with Republican legislatures are using the disingenuous concerns of “voter fraud” and “ballot security” to consider restricting the voting methods that helped millions of voters cast ballots during the pandemic.As polarization has grown in our country, there have been more dedicated attempts to make this an anti-democratic and un-American nation. This coordinated culture war started by far-right extremists is an attempt to stop voters from casting their ballots freely, safely and equally. It’s time to heal from the days of segregation and poll taxes.We must unite and move forward from this country’s wrongdoings, we must talk openly and honestly with one another. Together, we can ensure that everyone is free to cast their ballot and dismantle the pains of racism gripping our nation.As we have seen, people of color have been pivotal in some recent elections. Republicans are determined to stop that by implementing measures – like new ID requirements, restricting vote-by-mail and banning extended hours during early voting – that disproportionately hinder voters of color. The struggle for the soul of this democracy and the free, fair and nondiscriminatory access to the ballot is worth fighting for.In a democracy, the vote and the ability of eligible persons to exercise the right to vote is central to a legitimate form of government and the democratic process.We should all be pushing for comprehensive legislation to modernize our voter registration system, ensure equal access to the ballot box for all Americans, prohibit voter intimidation and other deceptive practices that keep people from exercising their constitutional right to vote. We were forced to flee Texas and have come to DC to ask our Congress to act now and pass both the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. These bills would strengthen the freedom to vote for all Americans – across race and region – by making sure that attempts to create barriers to voting that discriminate against voters based on our color, background or zip code are prohibited, so we all have an equal say in our future. As our right to vote is under siege in Texas and across this country, I urge every one to speak up, show up and stand up. Our Texas Democratic legislators will not stand down before political bullies that are trying to dismantle our democracy, take away our voices and void our civil right to vote. We will continue this fight for all Texans and all Americans, because it is the right thing to do. © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

 A powerful House panel on Thursday approved a sweeping set of proposals aimed at weakening Big Tech. It passed a series of measures imposing new obligations on top digital platforms, prohibiting them from abusing any gatekeeper power, and in some cases opening the door to new fines and breakups.In a marathon two-day session stretching across nearly 29 hours, lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee sent six bills to the House floor that would represent the most significant change to US antitrust law in decades.The toughest bills outlaw what committee members have alleged are the most blatantly anti-competitive tactics practiced by Big Tech.Under those proposals, Amazon(AMZN) would be barred from owning the same e-commerce platform on which it competes with independent sellers. Facebook(FB) could not acquire startups that it may perceive to be a future competitive threat. Google would be prohibited from promoting YouTube in search results over other video rivals. And Apple(AAPL) may be required to allow third-party app stores on iOS. The proposed policies drive straight at the heart of some of Big Tech’s key business models. House antitrust bills could change the internet as we know it. Here s howThe bills would make it illegal for large tech companies to unfairly elevate their own products and services on platforms they own, as with Google pushing YouTube videos, or to use their control of multiple platforms to hurt other businesses that depend on those same platforms, as some allege against Amazon in its treatment of sellers.“These measures would be the most significant reforms in the US competition law system since Hart-Scott-Rodino, which was 45 years ago in 1976,” said William Kovacic, former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, referring to the Ford-era law establishing public transparency requirements for mergers and acquisitions.The bills do not name the individual companies — though some lawmakers Thursday expressed openness to doing so as a way of narrowing the legislation’s intended scope. Instead, the bills outline a general definition for tech giants that antitrust regulators would be expected to use in identifying companies subject to the laws. This includes market cap and monthly user thresholds.Under the bills, if the Federal Trade Commission or the Justice Department find that a covered company has abused its gatekeeper power, the agencies could potentially sue for fines or a breakup.The results could create massive changes for the internet as we know it. The House markup comes as the tech industry confronts growing pressure from policymakers and regulators worldwide. Google has been hit by multiple antitrust lawsuits by federal and state officials alleging abuses in online search and advertising. State and federal officials have sued Facebook over what its critics have called a “killer acquisition” strategy. Apple this spring went to trial to defend against allegations by Epic Games, the maker of “Fortnite,” that Apple’s app store monopolizes app developers’ access to the iPhone. Amazon faces renewed antitrust scrutiny amid its acquisition of media heavyweight MGM.In recent months, European officials have launched a steady stream of investigations into a range of business practices by Apple, Google and Amazon. Europe’s top court affirmed this month that data privacy regulators across the continent — not just those in the same jurisdiction as corporate headquarters — can hold digital platforms such as Facebook accountable. The House bills mark the most comprehensive effort this side of the Atlantic to craft a national set of rules governing digital platforms. “Today, we have sent a clear message,” said Rep. David Cicilline, who led the charge on a 16-month investigation of the tech industry last year that culminated in the legislation. “The United States will no longer let other countries lead the fight against unregulated monopoly power. America is ready to hold Big Tech accountable so we can build a stronger online economy.” Biden names Lina Khan as FTC chairThe tech industry launched an all-out assault to thwart the US bills ahead of Wednesday’s markup. Its trade groups and lobbyists said Congress was moving too fast and that the bills could lead to unintended consequences for consumers. The companies themselves issued dire warnings: Amazon said that if it’s forced to choose between selling retail goods on its own and operating an e-commerce marketplace for everyone, it would choose the former, resulting in lost business for half a million sellers who use its platform. Apple said that allowing iOS users to download apps from anywhere could lead to security and privacy breaches.Some lawmakers echoed those concerns during the legislative session, saying that many of the bills were overly broad in scope or risked giving the federal government too much power. Conservative lawmakers repeatedly sought to amend the bills so that they would address claims of anti-conservative bias; one early amendment attempted to bar the FTC and DOJ from using congressional funding to promote critical race theory. The amendment was dismissed as not relevant to the antitrust issues at hand. A bipartisan coalition of California lawmakers, some of whom represent Silicon Valley, worked throughout the session to challenge the bills, citing “basic questions” they said the authors failed to answer. For example, they said, it is not obvious how the bills would affect specific products used by millions of consumers. Europe ramps up pressure on tech giantsBut proponents of tough new restrictions called for swift action to shore up the nation’s competition laws, arguing they were necessary to save small businesses threatened by Big Tech. “Each bill is an essential part of a bipartisan plan to level the playing field for innovators, entrepreneurs and startups, and to bring the benefits of increased innovation and choice to American consumers,” said House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler at the outset of Wednesday’s proceedings. As the bills left the committee, Rep. Ken Buck, a leading Republican co-sponsor of the legislation, claimed victory over what he said was pressure from the tech industry to sink the effort.“Big Tech lobbied against all six antitrust bills, saying they would not pass out of Committee,” Buck tweeted after the bills’ passage on Thursday. “I’m proud to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to Break Up Big Tech and advance these bills to the House floor.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

143,,"In Kansas, the secretary of state now needs the approval of a legislative committee to settle election-related lawsuits. In Arkansas, a new law empowers the state’s elections commission to investigate every aspect of an election “without limitation.”And in the key battleground state of Arizona, Republican legislators this week moved to weaken the authority of Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, by limiting her ability to defend election lawsuits. With efforts to pass federal election legislation stalled in the US Senate, voting rights advocates are issuing fresh warnings about an array of provisions that allow legislators and others in Republican-led states to seize power from the officials who oversee elections day-to-day. The Republican moves come after election officials in both parties resisted efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election results – and as Trump continues to gripe about a “stolen” election and urge more “audits” of ballots cast last year in states President Joe Biden won.  Ridiculous : Schumer slams Republicans for blocking Democrats  voting rights billDemocrats and progressive activists argue that the measures could allow the conduct of future elections – including counting ballots and certifying results – to fall prey to partisan meddling, not unlike the controversial review of ballots in Maricopa County, Arizona, authorized by Republicans in the state Senate.“If the worst of these laws had been in place in 2020, they might well have interfered with the clearly expressed will of voters in state after state,” said Norm Eisen, a CNN legal analyst and the executive chairman of the bipartisan States United Democracy Center. The group and its research partners have tracked at least 216 bills in 41 states that would criminalize the actions of election officials, give legislators more power over the running of elections or otherwise interfere. In all, two dozen have become law so far, the organization found. More measures await action. “This should be terrifying to anyone who cares about democracy,” Eisen added. Biden on Thursday said Republicans are trying to throw out votes if they don’t like the results. “Who is God’s name, as my mother would say, died and left them boss?” he said. “Your vote has to count when you cast it.”Republicans at the forefront of the new laws say their actions will help ensure election integrity and guard against local election officials overstepping their authority.“They are not takeovers as much as strengthening the already statutorily mandated duty” of the state’s election commission, Arkansas state Rep. Mark Lowery said of provisions he helped enact that give the state panel broader investigative powers.The action follows a dispute over ballot counting last year in Arkansas’ most populous county.More measures are on the horizon. On July 8, Republicans in the Texas legislature are likely to revive their efforts to pass voting restrictions during a special session called this week by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. Last month, Democrats in the Texas state House temporarily thwarted the sweeping Republican proposal when they staged a late-night walkout, denying the GOP majority the quorum to advance the bill on the final day of the legislative session.But the Texas legislature could resurface new criminal penalties on election workers. Under the bill that Republican lawmakers advanced in May, election officials in Texas would face potential criminal charges if they fail to count “valid votes” or send a vote-by-mail ballot to someone who didn’t request it.The laws that threaten election workers with criminal penalties or expand legislative influence over election administration span the country.A bill that passed the Republican-led legislature in Wisconsin this week would make it a crime for municipal election clerks to fill out missing information a voter’s absentee ballot paperwork. Wisconsin’s Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is likely to veto the measure.And in Arizona, the Republican legislature has made it a felony for a public official to modify any deadline or election filing date unless ordered to do so by a court. Another measure, tucked into a budget provision approved Wednesday by the state Senate, establishes the Arizona’s attorney general as the “sole authority” to defend state election laws and bars the secretary of state from using any public funds for hire outside lawyers. It also limits Hobbs to hiring the equivalent of one full-time lawyer to represent her office.RELATED: This is democracy in America in 2021That bill also creates a special committee to recommend legislative changes based on the results of the problem-plagued “audit” of Maricopa County’s 2020 ballots. The Republican-led Senate authorized the partisan Maricopa audit, which has drawn rebukes from Hobbs and Republican officials in the county.The moves in Arizona follow other Republican-led efforts to exert influence on elections. In Georgia, the state’s new law gives the Republican-controlled legislature the power to select three out of five members of the state elections board. At the same time, the state board now has the power to determine whether a county’s elections officials are performing poorly and empowers the state board to replace them temporarily with a hand-picked election administrator.Additionally, lawmakers removed the secretary of state as a voting member of the state elections board. The current Secretary of State, Republican Brad Raffensperger, resisted Trump’s false claims of election fraud in 2020 and now faces a primary challenge from a strong ally of the former president, GOP Rep. Jody Hice. An Iowa law now makes it a crime for local election officials to buck the guidance of state’s election chief. And in Kansas, the Republican-controlled legislature last month overrode Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s vetoes of election bills. One of the new laws requires a legislative council to approve the secretary of state entering into a consent decree.In deep-red Arkansas, a new law grants broad investigative powers to the state elections board to probe complaints about a wide range of election functions, from the delivery of absentee ballots to vote tabulation. State election commissioners also can use the state police to seize public records as part of their investigations.Lowery, the Republican who was one of the law’s lead sponsors, said the change was warranted after election officials Pulaski County, Arkansas, home to Little Rock, acknowledged erroneously counting a batch of ballots in a razor-thin contest for a state House seat. The Democrat won by some two dozen votes.Lowery said the local prosecutors’ office, led by a Democrat, should have investigated. “When you have partisan, elected prosecutors, you may not get cooperation in terms of investigating and prosecuting election impropriety,” he said.Companion bills introduced this week in Congress by a cluster of Democratic senators and House members seek to insulate local election officials from what its sponsors called “election subversion” at the state level. Among its provisions, the proposal would allow local election officials to fight removal proceedings in federal court if their duties include overseeing congressional and presidential contests.But that proposal – along with other voting measures – faces long odds on Capitol Hill after Republicans in the Senate this week blocked debate on another election bill – a sweeping voting and ethics bill, known as the For the People Act. Democrats cast the bill as a counterweight to state-level efforts to restrict voting. Republicans argue it amounts to federal overreach in state matters.No voting bill can gain traction in a 50-50 Senate, unless moderate Democrats such as West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema agree to reduce the 60-vote supermajority needed to overcome a filibuster and advance most legislation in the chamber. They have given no signs that they intend to do so – with Sinema this week, writing an op-ed, defending the filibuster.Activists say they plan to mount pressure campaigns on moderate Democrats to abandon, or at least relax, the filibuster rule for election-related legislation. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the Democrat who oversees the Senate Rules Committee, is planning a field hearing on the For the People Act in Georgia. Biden said he plans to travel the country to make the case for voting rights. And Democratic-aligned groups have pledged to step up efforts to encourage their likely supporters register to vote and better navigate new state laws. Priorities USA Action, a major Democratic super PAC, this week announced it would spend an initial $20 million on legal action and voting initiatives to combat Republican laws in the states. But voting rights activists worry the raft of laws giving state legislators more sway over elections could undermine all their organizing efforts.“Even if we do everything right,” said Cliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, “even if we outwork them and we get turnout up, it’s the fail-safe that allows them to say no matter what the count is, ‘We don’t think this was legal. We think this was fraudulent. We think this county’s ballots should be thrown out.’ ”© 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

144,,"Congress still has a long way to go before they get to a vote on infrastructure, but President Joe Biden said Thursday that he has agreed to a deal with a bipartisan group of senators. While many details of what it contains remain unclear, the total cost of the proposed deal announced Thursday is $1.2 trillion over eight years, with $579 billion in new spending, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.Here s how Biden s Infrastructure plan would impact key areas of American lifeThat is far short of the $2.25 trillion plan Biden unveiled in March. That plan included money for roads, bridges, public transportation, airports, water and power systems as well as broadband improvements. It also would have made investments in caregiving for aging Americans and in workforce training – drawing criticism from many Republicans, who wanted to stick to classic infrastructure items. Democrats say they are still planning to push some of the provisions left out of the infrastructure plan through separate legislation. RELATED: Here’s what’s in Biden’s infrastructure proposalThe new bipartisan proposal emerged this week after the breakdown of an earlier round of bipartisan negotiations with a group of Republicans led by West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito. Here’s what we know about it so far:The bipartisan plan includes $109 billion for roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects – significantly less than the $159 billion Biden initially requested for these investments. The plan would provide $49 billion for public transit, $66 billion for rail, $25 billion for airports and $16 billion for ports and waterways.Another $55 billion would be invested in water infrastructure and $73 billion in the nation’s power structure. Some of this money would be used to eliminate the nation’s lead service lines and pipes. The plan would provide $65 billion to make improvements to the country’s broadband system.Biden initially wanted to spend $100 billion to make sure every American has reliable, high-speed internet service. But said he was willing to lower his ask in earlier negotiations with Republicans. It includes $7.5 billion to build a network of electric vehicle chargers along highways and in rural and disadvantaged communities. The goal is to build 500,000 chargers.Another $7.5 billion would go toward making thousands of school and transit buses electric. The full details on how the package would be paid for remain to be seen, but the bipartisan proposal focuses on using unspent funds from prior relief packages, as well as revenue from selling off strategic oil reserves.Lawmakers believe that they could bring in more than $100 billion from unspent pandemic unemployment benefits funding and from pursuing fraudulent jobless payments. Whether these measures would provide that much money is questionable. How Democrats are laying the groundwork now for a potential reconciliation bill At least 26 states have said they would end at least one of the pandemic unemployment benefits programs – including the $300 weekly federal boost – early in order to address widespread worker shortages. Congress extended the three programs through early September in the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion relief bill that was enacted in March.Estimates of the value of the unspent benefits vary. The Century Foundation has pegged it at more than $22.5 billion.Unemployment fraud has also been a major issue since the pandemic began, with criminals targeting the more generous payments provided by Congress’ historic expansion of the nation’s unemployment system. Again, estimates vary widely. The US Department of Labor Inspector General Office in late March estimated that at least $89 billion of the projected $896 billion in federal unemployment program funds could be paid improperly, with a significant portion attributable to fraud. The head of an identity verification company told Axios recently that as much as 50% of all unemployment claims – more than $400 billion – could be fraudulent.The US Secret Service last month helped recover around $2 billion in fraudulently obtained Covid-19 relief funds, including unemployment benefits and aid to businesses, and seized more than $640 million from accused fraudsters, the agency said last month.RELATED: Were half of Covid unemployment benefits stolen? Here’s what we knowThe bipartisan proposal also calls for repurposing $80 billion in Covid relief funds, mainly from the March and December rescue deals.Biden’s original plan also called for ramping up enforcement against corporations to ensure they pay their fair share of taxes. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated increasing funding for enforcement would raise about $60 billion. Lawmakers negotiating the bipartisan deal estimated that it would yield more than $100 billion.The deal appears to set aside Biden’s effort to pay for the plan by raising taxes on businesses. He had proposed hiking the corporate income tax rate to 28%, from 21%, and increasing the global minimum tax rate on US corporations to 21%, among other changes. Republicans, however, strongly opposed the idea.The deal leaves out Biden’s proposal to spend $400 billion to bolster caregiving for aging and disabled Americans – the second largest measure in his original package.His plan would have expanded access to long-term care services under Medicaid, eliminating the wait list for hundreds of thousands of people. It would have provided more opportunity for people to receive care at home through community-based services or from family members.RELATED: Pandemic pushes Medicaid enrollment to record highIt would also have improved the wages of home health workers, who now make approximately $12 an hour, and would have put in place an infrastructure to give caregiving workers the opportunity to join a union.Also left on the sideline: $100 billion for workforce development, which would have helped dislocated workers, assisted underserved groups and put students on career paths before they graduate high school.CNN’s Lauren Fox, Phil Mattingly and Kate Sullivan contributed reporting.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/24/politics/infrastructure-plan-explained/index.html
145,,"The White House on Thursday announced a number of new incentives from the private sector as it looks to increase Covid-19 vaccination rates among young people, a group it has specifically targeted as a high-priority demographic.From free Panera bagels and Chipotle burritos to delivery service gift cards for college students, the incentives come days after the White House acknowledged the US would fall short of President Joe Biden’s July Fourth Covid-19 vaccination goals, saying the country has more work to do to get younger Americans vaccinated.Many of the incentives were announced by second gentleman Doug Emhoff, who spoke with Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy on a press call Thursday about the importance of vaccinating young people. “Less than half of people age 18-24 have one shot. That’s 42%,” Emhoff said. “The reality is many younger Americans have felt like Covid is not something that impacts them and they have been resistant to getting the shot,” he added.As of this week, Panera will give free bagels to those who get vaccinated between July 2 and July 4. Vaccinated customers who buy burritos will get one free at Chipotle on July 6. GoPuff, the delivery service popular on college campuses, said it will give $100,000 worth of GoPuff credits to certain community colleges and universities across the country. Shine, a mental health app, will offer a free 15-minute “Relax While You Get Vaxxed” meditation to enjoy during a vaccine appointment. The meditation will be live on the app starting next week, the company said in a tweet.Emhoff added that gaming services Twitch and Riot will run ads on their platforms and work with influencers to reach young Americans with public health information.“These platforms touch millions of young Americans every day, and we know that hearing about vaccinations from someone you follow or someone you trust or the mental health app that you use may be just as important as it is hearing it from us at the White House,” Emhoff said.In addition to the efforts noted by Emhoff, Walgreens is offering $25 in Walgreens cash rewards to individuals vaccinated at store pharmacies. Instacart, the grocery service, is raffling off $500 gift cards to those who are vaccinated by June 30.Vaccine coverage among young adults has been lower and is increasing more slowly over time than in other age groups in the United States, and the intent to be vaccinated is lower among younger adults, according to studies published Monday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.If the weekly pace of vaccinations continues at the same rate from the week of May 22, only 57.5% of adults under age 30 will have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by the end of August.Earlier this week, White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said the administration is now focused on getting younger Americans, particularly 18- to 26-year-olds, vaccinated against the virus. He said the White House would be working with state and local leaders on outreach efforts.CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Kate Sullivan and Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/24/politics/white-house-vaccine-incentives-young-americans/index.html

 When walking into a traditional department store or browsing your favorite online retailer, shoppers typically navigate clothing options by first choosing a section based on its gender label: Men’s or Women’s, Girl’s or Boy’s. But some fashion-lovers don’t identify within this gender binary, and they, and in particular Gen Z consumers, are creating demand for more inclusive and gender-neutral fashion offerings. That’s prompting stores who want to attract their dollars to pay attention. For instance, teen retailer PacSun’s summer 2021 marketing campaign features what it calls “gender-free” styles, a category it introduced in September 2020.It includes a new PacSun gender-free, eco-fashion line called Colour Range with a variety of cotton-based staples, such as sweatpants and hoodies. The gender neutral store on its website already features a collection of T-shirts, sweatpants, cargo and slim-fit pants in solid colors and tie-dye prints.Abercrombie & Fitch(ANF) launched its first gender-inclusive clothing collection, called the “Everybody Collection,” in 2018 for kids ages 5 to 14, because of customer demand. It features an assortment of children’s clothes, including camouflage prints, bomber jackets and crew neck sweatshirts and tees influenced by skate culture. LGBTQ Rights Milestones Fast FactsMore recently, in May, the clothing chain launched a new collection in collaboration with The Trevor Project, a suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning (LGBTQ) young people. The gender-inclusive collection for kids and adults includes t-shirts, shorts, hoodies, jackets, hats, sandals and a fragrance. The clothes in the collections that brands are launching are not restricted to certain colors and fits separate for girls, boys, men and women. Instead, they are “genderless” in that the fashion is fluid, not inherently masculine or feminine, and the styles can fit all body types.Stores have good reason to roll out such collections. A December 2020 survey by global marketing and consulting firm Wunderman Thompson of 1,000 US consumers aged 16-24, 70% of those surveyed agreed or strongly agreed that gender doesn’t define a person as much as it used to. “Fashion mirrors the culture and political beliefs of a generation, which are often led by younger people,” said Shawn Grain Carter, professor of fashion business management at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.June is Pride Month. Wall Street has taken notice“If traditional retailers like Nordstrom and Saks are to survive, they must reflect the value system of this generation to gain lifetime loyalty,” said Carter.One brand is helping department stores do just that. The Phluid Project, a gender neutral clothing label, is available at more than 5,000 stores through partnerships with retailers like Nordstrom(JWN), Target(TGT), Sephora and, most recently, luxury retailer Saks Fifth Avenue’s outlet stores, Saks Off Fifth.“We live in a binary society. So what I love about the younger Gen Z consumers is that they are challenging this construct in everything, including in fashion,” said Rob Smith, CEO and founder of the Phluid Project. Lego celebrates Pride Month with its first-ever LGBTQIA+ setOn June 4, Saks Off Fifth launched its first exclusive gender-neutral clothing and accessories line, with 100% of the proceeds to be donated to The Phluid Foundation, the advocacy arm of Smith’s label. The collection features rainbow designs on T-shirts, hats, sneakers and tote bags for under $50.Sara Griffin, senior vice president of marketing for Saks Off Fifth, said the collection with the Phluid Project “is a first step” to catering to a younger generation of shoppers that is less concerned with the traditional gendered approach to clothing. “We are listening to our customers and will continue to make adjustments,” she said, adding that the company’s partnership with Phluid will continue with new merchandise in the fall. Editor’s note: This story originally referred to the new PacSun gender-free fashion line by a different name, which it had announced in an April press release. The company subsequently changed the name to the current Colour Range internally, and will be officially announcing the change publicly in the fall. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

147,,"President Joe Biden took his first big trip as president this week when he went to Wisconsin for a CNN town hall. The fact that Biden chose to go to Wisconsin shouldn’t be lost on anyone. He will likely be going to the state a lot as president. Arguably, no state tells us more about Biden’s or any president’s political standing in the last 30 years than Wisconsin. It’s also likely to tell us whether his party does well in the 2022 midterms.If you wanted to know who won the presidency in the last three elections, you needn’t look further than the Badger State. It was one of just three states that voted for Biden in 2020, Donald Trump in 2016 and Barack Obama in 2012 (the other two are the key battlegrounds of Michigan and Pennsylvania). But Wisconsin’s importance goes deeper than just this fun tidbit of trivia. Wisconsin was the state that put Biden to the 270 electoral vote threshold in the Electoral College. Had Biden carried every state he won by more than his 0.63 point margin in Wisconsin, he’d have been at 269 electoral votes. Put another way, Wisconsin got Biden the presidency. Similar math holds for Trump in 2016. Wisconsin was the state that got him to and over 270 electoral votes, unless we count faithless electors. Now, look at every election since 1992. We’ll do so by comparing the margin in every state in every presidential election to the margin in the state that put the winning candidate over the top in the Electoral College in that same election (just like Wisconsin has done in the last two elections). We’ll call this measure the swing state index. A swing state index close to zero in any election means a state is really important in a given presidential election. Since 1992, the absolute value of Wisconsin’s swing state index has averaged 1.3 points. No other state has had an average absolute swing state index closer to 0, which equates to Wisconsin being the state that has told us the most about where the Electoral College stands on average since 1992.Further, Wisconsin is one of only two states (along with Pennsylvania) that has had no election in which the swing state index has been larger than +5.0 points or smaller than -5.0 points since 1992. This is another indication that Wisconsin has pretty much always been a state that you can count on to give you a good read of the presidential election.If Wisconsin is close in an election, you can bet the overall election is also close. The ability to be a consistent swing state is rare. For instance, the swing state index in Tennessee in 1992 was 0 (i.e. the state that put Bill Clinton over the top in the Electoral College). In 2020, Tennessee’s swing state index was -24 points (i.e. way more Republican). Georgia’s swing state index swung wildly from -4 points in 1992 to -14 points in 2004 to -0.4 points in 2020. Wisconsin has maintained its swing state status, even as coalitions within the state have changed dramatically.In 1992, the swing state index was -0.3 points or very close to being the state that put Clinton over the top in the Electoral College. Clinton’s coalition spread across the state from urban to rural areas with 36 of the state’s counties voting more Democratic than the state as a whole and 36 voting more Republican than the state as a whole. But just as tiny populated rural areas became more Republican and highly populated urban areas became more Democratic nationally, so too has this been the case in Wisconsin. In 2020, just 14 of the state’s 72 counties were more Democratic than the state as a whole. Biden won in large part by crushing it in Dane (which contains Madison) and Milwaukee counties. Of course, there won’t be any presidential elections for a while. Beyond the battle for the top spot in our nation’s government, Wisconsin has proved a useful barometer in down ballot races over the last 15 years and could be a key state in the 2022 midterms. The state elected a Democratic governor in 2006 and 2018, which were both good years for Democrats. In-between, Scott Walker won terms in the midterm elections of 2010 and 2014.We’ll see if Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is able to win reelection in 2022.Likewise, the state has gone back and forth in who it elects to the Senate. Senate Democratic candidates have won in 2006, 2012 and 2018, which were all good years for Democrats. Republican Sen. Ron Johnson emerged victorious in 2010 and 2016. Johnson, if he chooses to run, is on the ballot in 2022, and it’s a state Democrats are hoping to flip. Johnson losing could signal that Republicans are in for a long night. Ultimately, Wisconsin could hold the key for Biden in the final two years of his first time. A Biden presidency with a Republican-held Senate will be far more difficult for him to navigate.© 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

148,,"President Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the Office of Management and Budget Neera Tanden will carry on with her outreach to senators next week after her confirmation was jeopardized Friday when Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin revealed he would vote against her.So far, Tanden has met with 35 senators on both sides of the aisle, according to a source involved with the confirmation process. “That outreach, which began moments after she was named, is continuing into next week,” the source said.The confirmation team has also been speaking with outside interest groups, including Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) organizations, the business community, women business leaders, and labor unions, to drum up support for her nomination, the source said. Manchin announced Friday he will vote against Tanden, making her confirmation unlikely given Republican resistance to her nomination. The senator’s decision means that unless a Republican senator comes forward to support Tanden’s nomination, it’s unlikely that she will be confirmed for the job, making key GOP votes more important than ever.Manchin says he ll vote against Biden OMB nominee Neera TandenSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has a narrow majority in a 50-50 Senate. Because Democrats control the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris can break ties, but without Manchin’s support, Democrats won’t have the votes on their own.GOP Sen. Mitt Romney’s office won’t say how he will vote on Tanden, and there was no immediate response from Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine or Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders is among the senators Tanden is expected to speak with next week. In an interview with Wolf Blitzer Friday evening, Sanders was non-committal about the nomination. “I worry less about what Ms. Tanden did in the past than what she’s going to do in the future,” he said. “I will be speaking to her early next week.”CNN reported earlier this month that Tanden and Sanders had sat down for a lengthy one-on-one meeting in recent weeks, ahead of her confirmation hearings. One person briefed on the meeting told CNN that meeting was over an hour and no stone had been left unturned, describing it as an opportunity for the two to discuss years of public clashing and private interactions.Biden has said he does not intend to pull Tanden’s nomination, saying, “I think we’re gonna find the votes to get her confirmed.”And White House press secretary Jen Psaki defended the nomination in a statement to CNN, saying that “Neera Tanden is an accomplished policy expert who would be an excellent Budget Director and we look forward to the committee votes next week and to continuing to work toward her confirmation through engagement with both parties.”An advocate for Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign, Tanden’s nomination angered not only conservatives, but also progressive Democrats, many of whom believed she’d played a role in bolstering Clinton’s nomination at the expense of Sanders.Tanden, who has most recently served as the CEO and president of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, faced sharp questioning over her past comments critical of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle during two Senate confirmation hearings last week. Sanders chided Tanden during a hearing before the Budget Committee, saying that some of her remarks amounted to “vicious attacks” against progressives.Tanden acknowledged at the time that her statements on social media “caused hurt to people,” saying, “I apologize to people on either the left or right who are hurt by what I’ve said.”Manchin focused on her previous comments in his own statement announcing his opposition. “As I have said before, we must take meaningful steps to end the political division and dysfunction that pervades our politics. At a time of grave crisis, it is more important than ever that we chart a new bipartisan course that helps address the many serious challenges facing our nation,” he said.An aide to Manchin told CNN Friday that the senator gave Schumer a heads up that he was going to make the announcement that he wouldn’t support Tanden. Manchin voted to convict former President Donald Trump earlier this month and has so far voted for every other Biden nominee. © 2023 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

151,,"Kelli Ward on Friday rejected calls for an audit into her recent reelection as the chair of the Arizona Republican Party and other party races, arguing that the state GOP does not have the structure to review them. “We don’t have the structure to be able to do an audit,” she said on KFYI’s radio show “The Conservative Circus with James T. Harris,” adding, “But we welcome their input to make elections bigger.”She added that the structure for an audit “doesn’t exist in our process, our procedures, our bylaws, in statute.” After promoting Trump s baseless fraud claims, Kelli Ward facing audit of her own Arizona GOP winWard, one of the most fervent proponents of former President Donald Trump’s false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him, claimed not only that an audit was not possible, but that calls for it were being pushed as a way to attack her. She argued that the only people demanding an audit are Sergio Arellano – a Tucson small business owner who challenged Ward for the top state party job – and people who were part of his campaign.Arellano did not respond to CNN’s request for a response to Ward on Friday.Last week, Ward secured a second stint as chair of the state party, beating Arellano by 3 percentage points. Arellano on Thursday requested an audit of the votes cast in the race for Arizona GOP chair and other party elections.“I anticipate the State GOP will do a solid job here and provide election officials around the state with an example of how to conduct a timely audit and how important ballot security and paper backups are,” Arellano said in a statement posted to Facebook. Arizona Republicans wrestle with their party s futureHe claimed that a “reversal of the stated results” in another party race prompted a “number of state committeemen” to raise concerns and reach out to him to ask that he request an audit. Sandra Dowling was announced the winner of a bid for Arizona’s 8th congressional district’s member-at-large committee, only to have the win pulled back because of an error.During the radio interview, Ward went on to attack the media, saying stories about the possible audit were trying to “gin up something that just doesn’t exist” and that “everything was above board” with the election.Ward’s tenure as chair of the party has been defined by her unwavering support for Trump, having repeatedly backed his maneuvers to overturn the presidential election results, including in Arizona, which Joe Biden won by more than 10,000 votes. The former vice president became the second Democrat since Harry Truman in 1948 to win Arizona in 2020.

The five whose lives were taken are still being grieved, among them Brian Sicknick, a police officer struck in the head with a fire extinguisher, and Rosanne Boyland, a member of the mob who was trampled by it and died, as a newly released video of the moment—apparently recorded on a police officer’s body cam—sickeningly shows. History will surely mark that day as a singular tragedy –a blood-soaked insurrection by pseudo-patriots worshiping in the “cult of Donald Trump.” But Republican lawmakers are moving on. They have turned the page, swallowed any revulsion they might have felt then and crawled back to Trump’s side, as they fight to help him once again escape responsibility for his behavior.They are doing this even though their lives were in danger that day, and even though the victims included Trump supporters. And even as a shocking new report by The New York Times shows how the mob trampled and may have killed one of their own on the Capitol’s marble steps. Republican leaders in Congress are siding with the man who incited the violence. Right after the tragedy, Senator Mitch McConnell and Rep. Kevin McCarthy pinned the blame for the bloodshed on Trump. But now they aren’t so troubled by it.The Times report showed how Boyland, a 34-year-old Trump superfan, was crushed by fellow rioters as “Trump 2020” banners flew. Her friend cried, “She’s dead!” Nearby a man in a cowboy hat shouted for his comrades to knock the gas masks off of police officers.The three others who died that day were Ashli Babbitt, 35, a rioter who was climbing through the glass door to the House chamber when she was shot by a Capitol Police officer defending fleeing lawmakers; Trump loyalist Kevin Greeson, 55, who died of a heart attack; and Benjamin Philips, 50, who died of a stroke. Philips founded a pro-Trump website devoted to opposing “communist marxist scummy democrats.” If Republicans don t denounce Marjorie Taylor Greene s extremism, they ll own itThe riot also injured 140 police officers. The mayhem and suffering can be laid at the feet of Trump, who spent months promoting the lie that he won the election and stoking his followers’ rage. He spoke to the crowd that day. “Fight for Trump, Fight for Trump!” they chanted. Then they attacked. Soon after the chaos, McConnell exhibited what looked like a genuine human response. “The mob was fed lies,” he said. “They were provoked by the President and other powerful people.”McCarthy, minority leader in the House, also said something that rang true. “The President bears responsibility,” he said.But that was then. On January 26, McConnell voted with 44 colleagues to stop the second impeachment trial of Trump. McCarthy began his own flip-flop when he told reporters last Thursday that Trump had not provoked the attack after all. Then he flew to make amends with the ex-president at his Florida resort. They posed for a photo, Trump grinning like a contented cat. According to news reports, the two agreed that Trump would work to help the GOP capture the House in 2022. McCarthy will get to grin himself if Republicans do retake Congress and he gets the speaker’s chair. Meanwhile, his contortions and McConnell’s retreat suggest that Trump was on to something when he called Washington a “swamp.”Cold-blooded creatures live in swamps. The risks of ignoring domestic terrorists are hugeThe 2020 election showed that Americans wanted Trump removed from power. Court after court had already rejected his narcissistic campaign of propaganda and lawsuits alleging the election had been stolen from him. The public release of a recording of his notorious phone call demanding officials in Georgia “find” more votes for him surely contributed to the Republicans’ defeat in that state’s two Senate races, which cost McConnell his position as majority leader.Although Trump is bad at elections and bad for America, he’s still good at manipulating the GOP.He has convinced them he is a martyr, not a loser, and commands the loyalty of the most fanatical of the party’s voters. The rabid members of any party can exert outsized influence in primary elections, and Trump and his children have indeed threatened officials who stand against him with primary challenges. Donald Trump Jr. attacked Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney after she voted in favor of impeaching Trump. Another Republican who voted for impeachment, Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, now has a primary challenger, a candidate who named his committee “Impeach Adam Kinzinger 2022.” Kinzinger and Cheney are sad outliers in a Republican Party hardened in their devotion to self-interest and desperately frightened of Trump. The moment of conscience that some Republicans experienced after the riot lasted less than a month. What will it take for the GOP to find its way back to the path of human decency, and stay on it a little longer?Must the next Rosanne Boyland or Brian Sicknick die in their arms for them to do the right thing?© 2023 Cable News Network.

153,,"The foundation set up by Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny has called on US President Joe Biden to impose sanctions on at least eight high profile Russian figures it says are close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) said it had submitted a broader list of 35 people in total in a letter addressed to Biden, dated Friday, with eight named on a “priority shortlist.” The letter says seven of the 35 individuals are already on US sanctions lists.The move comes ahead of nationwide protests planned this weekend in support of Navalny, who is being held in detention ahead of a court hearing next week.In a copy of the letter obtained by CNN, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich is named on the “priority shortlist,” for what FBK describes as being a key enabler and an alleged beneficiary of “Kremlin kleptocracy.” Abramovich is the owner of English Premier League soccer club Chelsea. A spokesperson for Abramovich said in an email statement to CNN that “there is no basis for such claims which are entirely without foundation.”Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko is also named for allegedly “covering up” Navalny’s poisoning and “hindering efforts” to evacuate the Russian opposition leader to Germany for medical treatment. CNN has reached out to the Russian Health Ministry for comment. FBK executive director Vladimir Ashurkov, who signed the letter, told CNN on Saturday that the foundation was calling on the US to put pressure on Putin to release Navalny. Alexey Navalny to remain in detention ahead of hearing“The letter is addressed to the President of the United States – the most powerful country. [The US] has a history of imposing sanctions on people who are involved in corruption. If anyone can do anything, it is the USA,” Ashurkov told CNN. The letter seen by CNN says Navalny for years has called for sanctions against individuals who he says are key to “aiding and abetting” Putin in the “persecution” of those who “seek to express their opinions freely and expose corruption in the [Russian] system,” adding that existing sanctions don’t target “enough of the right people.” “The West must sanction the decision makers who have made it national policy to rig elections, steal from the budget, and poison. It must also sanction the people who hold their money.” The letter continues: “anything less will fail to make the regime change its behavior.” Ashurkov said he and Navalny had worked on the list of 35 Russians before Navalny returned to Russia from Germany earlier this month, initially focusing on the main eight.In the letter, the list of 35 people is divided into three groups:“We didn’t want to make this list public until we did the full dossier on them. But after his [Navalny’s] arrest we knew we had to act,” Ashurkov told CNN. Navalny was detained on January 17, moments after arriving in Moscow following months of treatment in Germany after being poisoned in August 2020 with nerve agent Novichok.Yulia Navalnaya s husband was poisoned and detained. Now she is piling pressure on Vladimir PutinHe’s currently in custody ahead of a court hearing on February 2 where a court will decide whether his suspended sentence on fraud charges in a 2014 embezzlement case should be converted into a jail term due to what Russian authorities say is the violation of the terms of his suspended sentence. The letter states that the eight shortlisted individuals are of “particular priority.” They were discussed with Navalny shortly before he boarded the plane to travel back to Moscow, Ashurkov said.Ashurkov said Navalny’s team plans to submit the same request to the European Union and to the UK government.In an interview earlier this week with CNN, former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who served more than 10 years in a Russian jail after he fell out with Putin for highlighting official corruption, also said the new US administration must take the global lead to make sure his fate does not also befall Navalny.Speaking from exile in London, Khodorkovsky said personal sanctions must be imposed by Biden and others in the West on those closest to Putin, rather than broad sectoral sanctions. Khodorkovsky said targeting Putin’s entourage would be extremely painful for the Russian President and would affect the stability of his power.CNN’s Anna Chernova contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/30/europe/russia-navalny-foundation-biden-letter-intl/index.html

155,,"For more than four years, countries that rely on American foreign aid have been reeling from the profound impact that Donald Trump’s reinstatement of the Mexico City policy has had on women.The policy, known as the “global gag rule” among opponents, prevents non-government organizations that provide abortions, give counseling about abortions, or advocate for safe access to abortion from receiving US funding.But while the policy is meant to stop abortions, research shows that it has the opposite effect – and with deadly consequences for women. One 2019 study published in The Lancet found that during previous periods when the policy was in effect, abortions increased by 40% compared to periods where it was rescinded, contraceptive use dropped by 13.5% and pregnancies rose by 12%. On Thursday, US President Joe Biden rescinded the policy through a presidential memorandum, with reproductive rights advocates hailing it as a victory for the health and lives of women, girls and people who can become pregnant.During a signing ceremony in the Oval Office, Biden said the move will “reverse my predecessor’s attack on women’s health access.”He added that the measure “relates to protecting women’s health at home and abroad, and it reinstates the changes that were made to Title X (a family planning program that prohibits federal funds from being used for abortions) and other things making it harder for women to have access to affordable health care as it relates to their reproductive rights.”While the announcement has been welcomed by women’s rights groups and their advocates, and they are working toward a permanent repeal, they stress that the collateral damage of the Trump-era policy is vast, and that it will take more than just an announcement to rebuild entire health systems fractured by the policy. That’s because while previous incarnations of the rule under other Republican presidents primarily targeted family planning programs, Trump’s supersized version (the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy) impacted a wide spectrum of US funded health programs, spanning from HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment to malaria, tuberculosis, food, water, and sanitation programs.In 2019, Trump took that policy a step further, announcing the withdrawal of funding from any organization that provides funding to other groups that carry out abortions or discuss abortions with their clients.In total, the Trump administration’s expansion of the rule increased the amount of money affected by the policy by nearly 20-fold, from approximately $600 million to an estimated $12 billion. The loss of that funding cannot be overstated, according to organizations who refused to comply with Trump’s policy.MSI Reproductive Choices, a global non-profit that provides family planning advice and sexual health services, is one of them. The group said in a 2020 report that they lost $30 million in funding, money that over the course of Trump’s term they say would have served an estimated 8 million women with family planning services that would have prevented an estimated 6 million unintended pregnancies, 1.8 million unsafe abortions and 20,000 maternal deaths.MSI Reproductive Choices’ Ethiopia country director Abebe Shibru, who was the country director for MSI Zimbabwe during most of Trump’s term, said the policy “undermined the rights of women to exercise their rights to reproductive health.” Shibru told CNN that after the policy was reinstated, MSI’s outreach locations and services across Zimbabwe were slashed in half, shuttering reproductive health access for millions of disadvantaged women living in the country’s most remote areas. It’s a scenario that has been unfolding across many parts of Africa, he said, and one that will take time to repair.“You can’t just remove the damage of the last four years,” Shibru said. “It will take time.”Melvine Ouyo, a Nairobi-based reproductive health nurse and former clinic director at Family Health Options Kenya agrees, explaining that the effects of the policy didn’t just damage maternal health, but also impacted services including malaria, HIV and sanitation – and drove a wedge between crucial health partnerships, as groups that accepted the policy’s conditions became wary of contact with groups that did not. “They could not coordinate openly,” Ouyo said, explaining that she believesthe groups who did accept the policy’s conditions were concerned about losing funding. A United States Agency for International Development (USAID) spokesperson told CNN in November that “When a foreign NGO declines to agree to the (Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance) Policy, USAID transitions the activities that NGO would have undertaken, with US funding, to other partners, while minimizing any disruption of care.”However, a State Department review from August 2020 found that the policy did disrupt some efforts to treat tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS and to deliver nutritional assistance, among other programs.Ouyo said that the policy created a “chilling” effect not just in Kenya but across many other countries in Africa.“It created misunderstanding and lack of trust and made it hard for civil society groups to work in partnership,” she said.Ouyo also detailed another unexpected outcome of the policy: self-censorship. Organizations that accepted the conditions of the rule have declined to speak openly about its impact out of concerns that it could jeopardize future funding from the US Agency for International Development (USAID), she said.It’s an effect that has turned back the clock on reproductive rights and has halted the flow of information about reproductive rights across the globe, even in countries where abortion is legal.Read more: How Trump has sown global chaos for women and girlsIn Nepal, the legalization of abortion in 2002 is tied to a dramatic drop in maternal mortality. But research by the International Women’s Health Coalition (IWHC), which promotes reproductive health rights, found the rule had threatened to reverse those gains. In the IWHC’s 2019 “Crisis in Care” report, which documented the impact of the policy with their partners in Kenya, Nepal, Nigeria, and South Africa,a managing director of a global gag rule-compliant organization in Nepal said that as their workers provided counseling services, people would sometimes try to speak with them about abortion, but “in such cases, we tell our staff to tell them that they don’t know anything about it” – even though abortion is legal on a national level and that staff might know about safe places to access the service. And that’s the intended result of the Mexico City Policy’s so-called “gag,” reproductive health advocates say.The rule impedes the ability to share knowledge about the legal status of abortion and how to access safe abortion services through public health systems, with the consequence often resulting in people turning to unsafe abortion practices, reproductive rights groups and researchers say.One lawyer said in the IWHC report that in South Africa – where abortion is also legal, but can be difficult to access –that the policy “just makes a service that was already inaccessible even more inaccessible.” Now that the rule has been rescinded, communicating about safe abortion practices can resume, but being able to do so quickly – and effectively – with local partners on the ground will be key, said Nina Besser Doorley, Associate Director of Advocacy and Policy at the IWHC.Doorley explained that when policy changes in the US, “it can be very slow to sort of filter its way out into the field.”“So it’s really critical that as the policy is rescinded, that it’s also clearly communicated out. That’s one other thing I’d say is that this is a long-term problem. And it really leads to long term effects,” she said.And the longer that it takes for those lines of communication to reopen, the longer that stigmatization and secrecy around services could linger. “Policies like this single out abortion and take it out of health care – and silo and subject it to criteria that are based on ideology and not based on health best practices,” Doorley said.Doorley explained the knock-on effect of the policy on health care networks. “You can’t just reopen the clinic, you can’t just rehire the staff.” A lot of organizations that have lost funding under the policy have had to close clinics that were often the only easily accessible clinic for an entire community. Those people currently have increased barriers to access, given that they need to travel to another place to reach a clinic – which isn’t always a financially or logistically possible. Plus, the clinics that are still open might also be facing financial difficulties as a result of the policy, and have, in turn laid off staff or dropped other services. This can all add to the overall reduction of availability and quality of care for multiple communities, she said.“They (the Mexico City policy and subsequent expansions of the policy) increase stigma, they single it out and they put it separate from everything else,” Doorley added, explaining that clinics build up trust the longer they are in a community. If that relationship is severed by the provider closing, which many have had to do due to lack of funding under the policy, Doorley said, “you can’t just reopen the clinic, you can’t just rehire the staff. It takes time to reestablish presences and communities to rehire staff to rebuild the trust of their relationships, and all of that it’s way harder to do.” A US congressional aide who works on global health issues agreed, telling CNN this week that “the tail of the Global Gag is very long,” and that “it’s not a matter of flipping a switch and suddenly women…have access to care they didn’t have before.”That is one of the reasons why women’s reproductive rights groups are calling on the Biden administration to take a step further.Paula Avilla-Guillen, Executive Director at the Women’s Equality Center in New York, has joined a chorus of human rights defenders who are calling on Biden to permanently repeal the rule so that it cannot be reinstated by the next president, noting that as the policy has been reinstated and rescinded along political party lines since its inception in 1984, it has left the lives of some of the world’s most vulnerable people hanging in the balance of who holds the keys to the White House.“What we have seen over the years, is a kind of political play with women’s rights globally, by the Democrat and Republican parties,” Avilla-Guillen told CNN.Lawmakers and advocates are now working to put a stop to that. On Thursday, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, re-introduced the Global HER Act, a bill to permanently repeal the gag rule. In the US House, Illinois Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky has written legislation to repeal the Helms Amendment, which remains in effect regardless of the party in power. Schakowsky’s Abortion is Health Care Everywhere Act was introduced into Congress last year, and she will re-introduce that same bill in February. The Helms Amendment was enacted in 1973 and bars the use of US foreign aid for performing abortions, not just to foreign non-profits, but to governments, multilateral organizations and US non-profits.Schakowsky also noted the disproportionate impact the Mexico City Policy and the Helms rule have on poor women of color, saying that “these policies are clearly founded in racism that these women, these struggling women around the world, mostly black and brown, would not be able to have access to abortion.” Even with these efforts to reverse or end the policies, Avila-Guillen said the damage of the Trump legacy will take time to undo.“But what the Trump administration did was take one step further –a few steps forward – and only emboldened governments with overarching political power to try to restrict women and girls, as opposed to any type of equality in general.” Read more: Biden’s decrees vault America back onto the global stageIn October, the Trump administration aimed to seal its commitment to a global fight against abortion rights access, joining a group of largely repressive governments in co-sponsoring an international nonbinding declaration that states there is “no international right to abortion, nor any international obligation on the part of States to finance or facilitate abortion.”The Biden administration said on Thursday that it intends to withdraw co-sponsorship and its signature from the declaration, but it’s an example of how Trump’s tenure has emboldened authoritarian governments and anti-abortion groups that are still focused on dismantling any gains that women’s reproductive rights movement have made, despite the global gag rule, Avila-Guillen says.She points to Honduras – where abortion is banned under any circumstance – and that ratified a new law into its constitution on Thursday evening that now makes abortion reform nearly impossible.The legislation, which also prohibits legislating for equal marriage in the country, was backed by Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández’s ruling party, who was recognized by Trump’s administration as the winner of a widely disputed election in 2017 that the Organization of American States said was marred with irregularities that called the results into question.“Until we know how far back we went, we won’t know how many steps forward we need to take to catch up.” The move demonstrates the values that the Trump’s administration placed on women and girls, she said, explaining that its support for the Honduras government – one that has long dismissed the safety and rights of women and girls, given that Honduras is one of the most dangerous places to be a woman– is just one example. “A lot of the political statements of the Trump administration were saying to these governments that it was ok to enact harsher laws, it was ok not to care about women and girls,” Avila-Guillen said.She believes that it will take time to fully understand the impact that this version of the global gag rule – and the wider impact that the Trump administration’s rhetoric has had on global gender equality.“Until we know how far back we went, we won’t know how many steps forward we need to take to catch up,” she said. © 2023 Cable News Network.

 Google is expanding its options for when, where and how often employees return to the office. The company’s workers around the world can continue working remotely until September, after which they can choose between coming back to their pre-pandemic office, working out of a Google(GOOGL) office in a different city or permanently working from anywhere if their role allows it, a Google(GOOGL) spokesperson told CNN Business. The new policy, which will go into effect September 1, was shared with employees in a note from Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Wednesday morning, the spokesperson confirmed. Pichai said he expects 60% of the company’s global workforce will return to their pre-pandemic offices a few days a week, while 20% will move to a different office and the remaining 20% will work from home. It’s a slight departure from Google’s previous plan, in which all employees would have come into the office three days a week — a model Silicon Valley peer Uber(UBER) has already adopted. Google has roughly 140,000 employees around the world, with offices in close to 170 cities and 60 countries. Companies scramble to protect their workers from India s Covid surgeMany of the tech industry’s biggest companies are gradually laying out plans to bring employees back as vaccinations pick up pace and many economies start to reopen, offering a potential road map for what office work looks like in year two of the pandemic.Facebook(FB) has said it will also give employees the option of working remotely permanently unless their role requires being in the office, while Twitter has said employees can work from home “forever” if they so choose. Google on Wednesday also doubled its annual “work-from-anywhere” allowance to four work weeks, meaning employees can spend up to 20 days a year away from their main office.Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

157,,"Sen. Ted Cruz trekked down to Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night to have dinner with Donald Trump.How do I know? The Texas Republican senator tweeted an all-smiles picture of himself with the former President and this caption: “Had a great dinner tonight with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago.He’s in great spirits! We spent the evening talking about working together to re-take the House & Senate in 2022.” Had a great dinner tonight with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago. He’s in great spirits! We spent the evening talking about working together to re-take the House & Senate in 2022. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/OdtUBxHGSn He’s in great spirits! Good to know!What Cruz is doing here isn’t complicated. He wants to run for president in 2024 – particularly if Trump himself takes a pass on the contest. And Cruz is smart enough to know that, at least at the moment, the path to the Republican nomination goes directly through Mar-a-Lago. As in, there is a zero percent chance of winning if Trump is actively opposed to you doing so. If Trump says something nice about you publicly, so much the better!That Cruz feels the need to kiss the ring – and make it VERY public that he is doing so – after everything Trump has said about him (and his loved ones) speaks to the depths of capitulation (and obsequiousness) that even the ostensible future leaders of the party (like Cruz) are willing to stoop to in order to please the former president.What, again, has Trump said about Cruz?Well, he said that Cruz stole the Iowa caucuses. He suggested that Cruz’s father was somehow involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. He even insinuated that Cruz’s wife, Heidi, was unattractive. And who could forget that Trump bestowed the nickname “Lyin’ Ted” on Cruz. (“Lyin’ Ted holds the Bible high, puts the Bible down and then he lies,” Trump said repeatedly on the campaign trail in 2016.)And then there’s what Cruz has said about Trump. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!He called Trump a “pathological liar,” “utterly amoral, “a narcissist at a level I don’t think this country’s ever seen” and “a serial philanderer.” He suggested that Trump may have ties to the Mafia. He said that “if I were in my car and getting ready to reverse and saw Donald in the backup camera, I’m not confident which pedal I’d push.” He told Trump to “leave Heidi the hell alone.” And last but not least, Cruz pointedly refused to endorse Trump in a primetime speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention.Now, politics can be an ugly business, especially at the presidential level. And Cruz (and Trump) defenders will no doubt engage in a bit of whataboutism by noting that then-Sen. Kamala Harris savaged Joe Biden during the 2020 Democratic primaries over his opposition to busing to integrate schools.Which was harsh – and left some hard feelings that took a months for some in both camps to get over!But there’s a big difference between going after a past policy position held by a politician and suggesting his wife is ugly. Or that his dad somehow played a role in the assassination of an American president. Or that you hide behind your religion while lying constantly.Those sorts of attacks feel, to me at least, like the sort of stuff you don’t get over. Because they are totally outside the bounds of normal political hits, in that they are so deeply personal.That Cruz is not only willing to put all of that behind him (or tuck it away somewhere in the back of his mind) but also to celebrate Trump – Cruz floated the idea of arguing the ridiculous Texas election fraud case in front of the Supreme Court – is, frankly, astounding.It’s also a testament to the depths of Cruz’s ambition and the death grip that the 45th President of the United States still exerts on the GOP. © 2023 Cable News Network.

158,,"Content is created by CNN Underscored’s team of editors who work independently from the CNN newsroom. When you buy through links on our site, we may earn a commission. Learn more Growing and maintaining a beard is a lot like getting a new pet. First comes an adjustment period while you grow comfortable with each other, followed by a slight shift or two in your routine and finally a blissful coexistence when it’s impossible to imagine life without your furry friend.The key to beard longevity is proper grooming and care. Trimming and shaping beards is an age-old art form. “No tools are a good replacement for an expert barber,” says Matty Conrad, founder of Victory Barber & Brand. “Learning some necessary skills and grooming techniques is always going to be paramount when deciding to grow a beard.”Once you’re familiar with the basics, having the best tools and beard kits on hand at home is essential to keeping beards looking sharp. Nourishing products are also important for maintaining a happy and healthy face all around. We consulted grooming and skin care experts to find out their favorite tools of the trade. First things first: Prime the canvas for any beard with a top-notch cleanser. “In order to maintain healthy facial hair, you have to have a clean slate,” says Ryan Turner, a dermatologist in New York City. John Masters Organics Exfoliating Face Cleanser “includes plant and herbal extracts, essential oils and is great for getting rid of impurities,” he says. “Jojoba beads allow for gentle exfoliation without scratching the skin, and ginseng helps tone and brighten the skin.” The initial phases of beard growth can cause itching and irritation for some. A balm to soothe the skin while it becomes acquainted with its new canopy can work wonders. Proraso, an Italian brand founded in 1908, has been a go-to for generations of bearded gents.Once stubble makes its way into a more bushy shape and texture, cutting it down to size is best achieved with adjustable clippers. “Clippers are perfect for cutting down the bulk of the beard because of their wide set teeth,” Conrad says. “The guards make sure that you can control the length precisely when using them right against the skin.” Conrad’s favorite high-end option is by BaBylissPro, a favorite of many professional barbers. “The lithium ion battery provides plenty of power for cutting through a thick beard like a hot knife through butter,” he says. At a more modest price point, Conrad suggests Philips Norelco’s cordless and adjustable Series 5000. “This is a generally decent entry-level clipper that has guards and a dial that allow you to set a multitude of lengths, giving you a lot of control,” Conrad says. “It won’t make as smooth a result as a professional clipper, but it’ll do in a pinch.”Electric trimmers are best for the more detailed work of attending to beard borders and outer contours. “These are designed for cutting edges and outlines,” Conrad notes. Don’t mistake them for clippers, though, as they aren’t meant to cut the bulk of a beard. “The teeth are quite narrow,” Conrad says, which means they’re meant for more precise detailing.BaBylissPro is again Conrad’s favorite for a deluxe option. “This is what most barbers agree is the best trimmer on the market,” he says. “It cuts incredibly close and creates super-sharp lines. It’s the last trimmer you’ll ever need to purchase.”For a more affordable tool, Conrad likes Phillips Norelco’s Multigroom trimmer. “You can’t beat the price point on this one, and it is surprisingly effective,” he says, noting some sacrifice in longevity with the compromise in price.Keeping the neck and cheeks clean-shaven lends a lean, sophisticated look to an otherwise tufted face. A foil shaver or a simple razor are best “for getting hair right down to the skin and making sure there is no unsightly stubble, especially for guys with coarse hair,” Conrad says. An electric shaver can make quick and easy work of clearing up stubble, without the need for shave cream or brushes. For an investment piece that has countertop appeal, Conrad suggests the Braun Series 9. “This is definitely one of the most comfortable shavers on the planet,” he says. “The dock is perfect for keeping it clean and charged.”A tried-and-true classic, standard razors are always an option too. “Gillette Mach 3 is still my favorite for the day to day,” Conrad says. Some classic tools never go out of style. “If you are feeling nostalgic, you really can’t beat a classic safety razor,” Conrad says. Merkur makes a top-rated pick. Caring for a healthy beard entails tending to the hair itself and the skin underneath. “Hair that grows from your face is more coarse and has different needs” than the hair on your head, Conrad says. “There is usually a lot less natural oil production on the face than on the scalp, which can leave beards and skin feeling dry and itchy.” A good cleanser needs to gently detoxify while generously moisturizing both beard and skin, Conrad says. Victory Barber & Brand’s Hair and Beard Wash can actually be used on both the face and head, as it’s formulated with activated charcoal to detoxify skin and baobab oil to condition hair.Beard oil keeps both hair and skin moisturized and smelling fresh. A good beard oil “should penetrate into the skin and hair without leaving a shiny finish or a greasy residue,” Conrad says. Victory Barber & Brand’s Beard Oil is made with organic, microfine nourishing oils and includes essential oils with aromatherapeutic benefits, Conrad says. It’s also highly concentrated, so a little goes a long way. Turner likes Jack Black’s beard oil for its nourishing blend of natural ingredients, including kalahari melon oil and marula oil, which are rich in fatty acids. “Brown algae and carrot extract help protect against the damaging effects of free radicals,” he adds. Jack Black’s Beard Grooming Set also includes moisturizing cleanser and conditioner.For areas that are frequently shaved down to the skin, a soothing aftershave that prevents breakouts and irritation is a must. Turner recommends SheaMoisture’s Aftershave Elixir. “It’s excellent for those prone to acne or folliculitis that is triggered by shaving,” he says. “The combination of witch hazel and tea tree oil also makes a powerful cleansing and antimicrobial duo.”Shea butter and essential oils are the powerhouse ingredients included in SheaMoisture’s Complete Beard Kit, which comes with cleanser, conditioning oil, detangler and a soothing balm. A beard brush to tame the mane is also in order. “I always advocate for a brush rather than a comb, because it puts less tension on the hair,” Conrad says. “It can help smooth out the shape without making the beard puff out.” He notes that natural bristles are better than synthetics, as they help spread natural oils and beard oil through the beard. Zeus makes a top-rated and affordable option. With a beard comb, nourishing oil and beard butter, this set — according to one Underscored editor — is particularly nice because it doesn’t “leave you smelling like a coniferous mess, since every other company thinks all men want to smell like a forest.”Zeus is also a go-to for beard shampoo, conditioner and oil. Zeus Deluxe Beard Grooming Kits are available in sandalwood, verbena lime or vanilla rum scents to keep your nose smiling.Gillette’s King C. Gillette line, named for the company’s founder, offers refined beard care products from the brand trusted with men’s grooming for more than a century. The Complete Men’s Beard Kit includes a double-sided safety razor, shave gel, beard and face wash, balm and oil.Note: The prices above reflect the retailers  listed price at the time of publication.Receive product recommendations, reviews & deals several times a week.

Learn more Spanx’s faux leather leggings are one of the international shapewear savior’s bestsellers. Not only can their seamless fit and versatility take them from your daily stretches to your cardio routine, but their chic leather look makes it easy to pair them with a turtleneck for a perfect night-out look (not just because my mom said, “You look like Sandy from ‘Grease!’” as soon as I tried them on).Though the faux leather material certainly points to the classic ‘80s movie, the wear of these leggings is more like cotton. The body is a comfortable blend of 87% nylon, 13% spandex and elastane, topped with a polyurethane coating, while the contoured “Built-In Power Waistband” is a poly-spandex blend with elastane. The waistband’s glossy finish is designed to hug you in the right places, all while being next-level comfortable.While the leggings are quite pricey at $98, we wanted to get a pair ourselves so we could test them and really find out if they’re worth the price tag (spoiler alert: the answer is absolutely). I usually wear jeans 24/7, but working from home has deemed leggings, like it has for so many of us, my saving grace. My year-after-year favorites are from Marshall’s, and, contrary to popular trends, I’ve never owned the customer-favorite Lululemon leggings. As my first quality pair of leggings, I can confidently say that the Spanx ones are so worth their price tag.They have been glued to my hips for about a week and have been worn in while working at my desk, relaxing on the couch, going on a brisk walk (they are warm without being suffocating) and doing my 30-minute stretch and workout routine. I have a petite frame, and I was over the moon to discover Spanx carries the leggings in petite, regular and tall sizes. They do run a bit small, so going up a size is recommended.As mentioned, these leggings fit like a glove but are incredibly stretchable and breathable. At first, I noticed they were more suctionlike than the other pairs of leggings in my drawer (which really formed to my shape nicely), but they don’t feel too tight or restricting, even during workouts. It was like this pair of Spanx was tailored by the gods. I appreciated their high-waisted design, plus they don’t have a center seam, which means you don’t have to worry about any camel toe effect, especially if your top is a bit more cropped — another win!Though working from home has been the new normal for many professionals this year, you can totally get away with wearing these leggings with a longer tunic and a blazer for days at the office, when that becomes a thing again. I don’t have the urge to change into pajama bottoms throughout the day (after all, Zoom doesn’t pan down), but by the time 8 p.m. rolled around, I forgot I was even wearing these formfitting leggings. So, yes, you could get away with comfortably sleeping under the covers with this Spanx pair. Before washing them, I spilled my pressed powder on the upper thigh portion of the leggings, but a simple dab of cold water on the spot removed it like magic. For larger stains or your typical routine wash, they are machine-wash safe. Spanx recommends drying them flat, so I laid them down to air-dry. After they were dried, I noticed no noticeable change to their fit, comfort, breathability or stretch — even when I did Rockette-style kicks during my dance workouts. And pro tip: The leggings pair well with the brand’s matching faux leather medium impact sports bra ($68) for a workout, or this Spanx top (also $68) for a more dressed-up look.While I’m the type of person who typically prefers jeans over leggings for everyday wear, this versatile pair is an exception. They’re durable and will likely last for years to come (see their sparkling customer reviews for further reference), which makes their price tag more than justified. Wearing them made me feel both comfortable and confident — the dynamic duo that separates a meh pair of leggings from an exceptional one, and this Spanx pair is undoubtedly the latter.

160,,"YouTuber Jake Paul is trying to capitalize on his initial success in the boxing ring by challenging former UFC champion Conor McGregor.Channeling his inner-McGregor in a profane, insulting rant posted on social media, Paul publicly challenged McGregor and offered him $50 million to fight in a boxing match.“My team sent you a $50 million dollar offer this morning,” Paul said in the video. “$50 million cash, proof of funds, the biggest fight offer you’ve ever been offered. But you’re scared to fight me, Conor!… You’re 0-1 as a boxer. I’m 2-0 as a boxer.”McGregor has fought one boxing match before, losing in the 10th round to boxing legend Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2017. Floyd Mayweather will box YouTuber Logan Paul in FebruaryRepresentatives for McGregor and the UFC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN.Fresh off his knockout of former NBA player Nate Robinson, Paul is looking to challenge one of the most dangerous fighters in UFC history. McGregor has a 22-4-0 MMA record with 19 wins coming by way of knockout.The controversial Irish fighter, whose nickname is “The Notorious,” announced his retirement from UFC in March 2019 but returned in January to battle American fighter Donald “Cowboy” Cerrone at UFC 246 in Las Vegas, Nevada. He won by technical knockout 40 seconds into the first round.While McGregor announced he would be retiring in June, he came out of retirement yet again and is currently scheduled to fight Dustin Poirier at UFC 257 on January 23, 2021.Paul has fought twice professionally. Paul defeated YouTuber AnEsonGib in January in less than a round. In November, he defeated Robinson by knockout in the second round.Meanwhile, Mayweather recently announced that he would be fighting Paul’s older brother Logan in a “super exhibition” on February 20, 2021.Mayweather’s last competitive fight was against McGregor in 2017.© 2023 Cable News Network.

161,,"Shipping giants FedEx and UPS may have to make alternative plans to ship the new Covid-19 vaccine in areas that are expected to be affected by a major winter storm this week.The first public deliveries of the vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech took place Monday in every state plus Washington DC, and Puerto Rico. Officials expect to ship 2.9 million doses in the coming days.New York City could get a foot of snow in a major snow storm expected to slam Northeast on WednesdayThe storm is expected to develop on Tuesday and impact the eastern United States on Wednesday and early Thursday. People from southwestern Virginia to Massachusetts are under a winter storm watch. The heaviest snow totals are expected from Pennsylvania to southern New England, including New York City, where more than a foot of snow is possible.Travel could be very difficult or even impossible in some of the areas that the storm will hit, the National Weather Service said.FedEx spokeswoman Shannon Davis wrote in an email that as of Monday, the company didn’t expect any “significant impact” to service. “We have a team of 15 meteorologists monitoring conditions 24/7, and we have contingency plans in place should we see any severe weather,” she said.The company continues to monitor the forecast, she added.A UPS spokesman said the company recently opened a health care command center at Worldport, its global air hub in Louisville, Kentucky.“The command center watches every package of COVID-19 vaccines from origin to destination, and can step in with contingency plans should it appear that a package may be delayed,” said UPS spokesman Matthew O’Connor.Like FedEx, UPS has a full-time team of meteorologists.“We develop contingency plans based weather forecasts and local conditions, enabling our employees to safely deliver what matters most,” he said. The company has hired 100,000 seasonal employees and is well-staffed for vaccine and holiday shipments, O’Connor said.Army Gen. Gustave Perna, the chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, told reporters Monday that the operation had plans for many different issues, with the worst case scenario being an accident of a delivery vehicle or aircraft. Bad weather falls in the middle of the spectrum of problems, he said.Some doses will be held in a “safety stock” should there be an issue. The coronavirus vaccine rollout will be messy. People will have to deal with that.“My responsibility to deliver safe and effective vaccines means get ahead of that problem, so we’re constantly thinking where do we need to, where we can possibly be vulnerable and how can we mitigate it,” he said.The winter snowstorm will hit parts of the mid-Atlantic into New England beginning Wednesday, when shippers are scheduled to make 66 deliveries nationwide. Later in the week, other vaccines will be shipped in Pfizer’s distribution boxes requiring dry ice.Heavy snow is expected near and north of the Interstate 95 corridor from Washington to Boston. New York City could get as much as 14 inches, according to forecasts.There are winter storm watches in parts of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. Blustery wind conditions will also be a concern, with some areas, especially along the coast, coming close to blizzard conditions. Sustained winds of 25 to 35 mph are possible, with gusts as high as 45 mph at times.CNN’s Judson Jones and Taylor Ward contributed to this report.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/15/weather/fedex-ups-vaccine-delivery-weather/index.html

 Anna Wintour now has an even loftier title at Condé Nast. Wintour, who is already the editor in chief of Vogue US and artistic director and global content advisor of Condé Nast, will now also serve as chief content officer for the magazine conglomerate, a position in which she will oversee all brands including international editions. Condé Nast’s portfolio includes The New Yorker, Glamour and Wired. The move is part of Condé Nast’s effort to bring together its US and global operations as it seeks profitability. Wintour will stay especially close to Vogue, serving as the brand’s global editorial director. The promotion comes amid a turbulent year and a reckoning over diversity at Condé Nast that prompted speculation over Wintour’s future. In a staff memo in June, Wintour admitted that Vogue has made mistakes that were “hurtful or intolerant” to Black creators. “I take full responsibility for those mistakes,” she wrote. Wintour’s memo came shortly after Adam Rapoport resigned as editor in chief of Bon Appétit over accusations of bias and a discriminatory culture. Rapoport apologized for his “failings.” Wintour then helped recruit Dawn Davis, a Black executive in book publishing, to take on the open role.Condé Nast, like most companies in media, faced financial stress from the pandemic. In May, Condé Nast laid off about 100 US staffers as part of its “cost reduction plan for the COVID-19 crisis,” CEO Roger Lynch said at the time. In a Wall Street Journal interview published Tuesday, Lynch declined to comment on Condé Nast’s financial performance in 2020, other than to say the company “projected double-digit percentage revenue growth and 25% more editorial spending next year.”“Anna’s appointment represents a pivotal moment for Condé Nast as her ability to stay ahead in connecting with new audiences, while cultivating and mentoring some of today’s brightest talent in the industry, has made her one of media’s most distinguished executives,” Lynch said in a statement on Tuesday. As part of the strategy for bringing its US and international operations together, Condé Nast also announced several appointments to the new position of global editorial directors for a few of its magazines. The editor in chief of GQ US, Will Welch, has been named global editorial director of GQ. The editor in chief of AD, Amy Astley, has been named global editorial director of the brand, also known as Architectural Digest. The editor in chief of CN Traveller India, Divia Thani, has been named global editorial director of Condé Nast Traveler. Two of the company’s biggest magazines will still have separate US and international leadership, however. Edward Enninful, editor in chief of British Vogue, was named European editorial director for the markets owned and operated by Condé Nast, including the UK, France, Italy, Germany and Spain. Simone Marchetti, editor in chief of Vanity Fair Italia, was promoted to European editorial director of Vanity Fair, overseeing editions in France, Italy and Spain.Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
